1.Human leukoagglutinating antibody evokes cooperative leukotriene synthesis in pulmonary microvasculature. Model of transfusion-related acute lung injury. Leukoagglutinating antibodies have been implicated in the development of transfusion-related acute lung injury. In the present study, human neutrophil leukotriene generation was provoked by an anti-5b immunoglobulin G, isolated from a multiparous donor plasma that caused noncardiogenic lung edema during transfusion therapy. In 5b-positive polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the antibody stimulated marked arachidonic acid metabolism, dependent on the presence of plasma as the complement source. Quantity and profile of lipid mediators (leukotriene B4 and its omega-oxidation products, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of leukotriene A4) corresponded to those repeatedly described after PMN in vitro stimulation with the artificial calcium ionophore A23187. Anti-5b challenge of PMNs sequestered in the microvasculature of perfused rabbit lungs did, however, induce a markedly modified metabolite profile. Nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of leukotriene A4 were not detected, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid was markedly reduced. In contrast, cysteinyl leukotrienes were measured as predominant compounds, with rapid appearance of leukotriene C4 and more protracted generation of leukotriene E4. Leukotriene B4 and its omega-oxidation products were released with similar kinetics, but in lower amounts, as compared with the isolated PMN stimulation. Anti-5b challenge of PMNs coincubated with pulmonary artery endothelial cells in vitro, but not stimulation of either cell type alone, provoked marked generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes. These findings suggest modulation of PMN 5-lipoxygenase metabolism in favor of leukotriene A4 transfer to adjacent acceptor cells with subsequent enzymatic conversion to cysteinyl leukotrienes under conditions of lung vascular sequestration. Endothelial cells appear to serve as predominant cooperative cells under circumstances of blood-free lung perfusion. PMN-related transcellular eicosanoid synthesis may be involved in the pathogenesis of transfusion-evoked acute lung injury. 
2.Fasciculations due to verapamil in a patient with neuropathy. A patient with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy developed generalized fasciculations under verapamil which ceased after discontinuation of the drug. It is suggested that the increase in acetylcholine (ACh) release at the neuromuscular junction by verapamil may trigger fasciculation in the state of regeneration at ACh-sensitive sites of axon terminals and immature axon sprouts. 
3.Colonic motor activity in acute colitis in conscious dogs. The changes in motor activity of the colon during acute colitis were investigated in six conscious dogs. The motor activity was recorded with seven strain-gauge transducers. Colitis was induced in the entire colon by luminal perfusion of acetic acid. The dogs exhibited urgency and diarrhea with mucus and blood during colitis. The mucosa was diffusely erythematous and friable and there were scattered ulcerations over the mucosal surface. The motor activity of the colon changed in several ways during colitis: (a) the total duration per hour and the mean duration of contractile states decreased significantly; (b) the cycle length of colonic migrating motor complexes was significantly prolonged, and the nonmigrating motor complexes were almost completely absent; and (d) the incidence of giant migrating contractions increased significantly. About half of the giant migrating contractions were followed by defecation. The remaining expelled mucus or gas. Sometimes, a migrating motor complex in the colon was also followed by defecation; this was never observed in the normal state. The motor activity of the colon was still decreased and the cycle length prolonged 21 days after induction of colitis. However, the dogs were asymptomatic at this time and the mucosa looked normal at colonoscopy. The incidence of giant migrating contractions was also normal at this time. It was concluded that the dog is a good model for the study of colitis because of the similarity of symptoms with human ulcerative colitis. The phasic contractions of the colon decreases during colitis but the incidence of giant migrating contractions is increased. The diarrhea in colitis may primarily be due to the large number of giant migrating contractions in the middle and the distal colon. 
4.Proximal esophageal pH-metry in patients with 'reflux laryngitis'. Fiberoptic laryngoscopic examinations were performed on 40 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, 25 of whom had persistent laryngeal symptoms (dysphonia, cough, globus sensation, frequent throat clearing, or sore throat) and 15 without laryngeal symptoms who served as disease controls. Ten patients with laryngeal symptoms but none of the controls had laryngoscopic findings consistent with reflux laryngitis. Dual-site ambulatory pH recordings were obtained with the pH electrodes spaced 15 cm apart and with the proximal sensor positioned just distal to the upper esophageal sphincter. Patients in the three groups (disease controls: group 1; patients with symptoms but without laryngoscopic findings: group 2; and patients with both laryngeal symptoms and findings: group 3) were comparable in terms of age, smoking habit, the presence of esophagitis, and distal esophageal acid exposure. Proximal esophageal acid exposure was, however, significantly increased in groups 2 and 3, and nocturnal proximal esophageal acidification occurred in over half of these patients but in none of the group 1 patients. We conclude that the subset of reflux patients who experience laryngeal symptoms show significantly more proximal esophageal acid exposure (especially nocturnally) and often have laryngoscopic findings of posterior laryngitis not observed in control reflux patients. 
5.Characterization of spontaneous termination of sustained ventricular tachycardia associated with coronary artery disease. To characterize the change in cycle length and QRS morphology before spontaneous termination of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), electrocardiograms were recorded and VT cycle length measured for the periods 31 to 21 and 11 to 1 beats before termination in 55 episodes from 28 patients with coronary artery disease. Beats 31 to 21 were designated as a period of stable arrhythmia and served as a reference for changes occurring just before termination. Forty-four episodes of VT occurred in the setting of antiarrhythmic drug therapy; 11 episodes occurred in patients not treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Variability in cycle length was indexed by the standard deviation of the mean cycle length and by the percentage of consecutive cycles varying by greater than or equal to 40 ms (% greater than or equal to 40 ms). There was greater variability just before termination (standard deviation of the mean cycle length, 25.8 ms; % greater than or equal to 40 ms, 16.7%) than during the stable period (standard deviation of the mean cycle length, 8.5 ms; % greater than or equal to 40 ms, 5.4%; p less than 0.001 for both). This was true irrespective of antiarrhythmic drug use, although the differences in the standard deviation of the mean cycle length for beats 11 to 1 and for beats 31 to 21 were greater for the antiarrhythmic drug group (29.6 vs 8.9 ms, p less than 0.001) than for the group not receiving antiarrhythmic drugs (11.0 vs 6.7 ms, difference not significant). No specific patterns of cycle length variability characteristic of VT termination were found. 
6.Radiosurgery of acoustic neurinomas. Eighty-five patients with acoustic neurinomas underwent stereotactic radiosurgery with the gamma unit at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA) during its first 30 months of operation. Neuroimaging studies performed in 40 patients with more than 1 year follow-up showed that tumors were smaller in 22 (55%), unchanged in 17 (43%), and larger in one (2%). The 2-year actuarial rates for preservation of useful hearing and any hearing were 46% and 62%, respectively. Previously undetected neuropathies of the trigeminal (n = 12) and facial nerves (n = 14) occurred 1 week to 1 year after radiosurgery (median, 7 and 6 months, respectively), and improved at median intervals of 13 and 8 months, respectively, after onset. Hearing loss was significantly associated with increasing average tumor diameter (P = 0.04). No deterioration of any cranial nerve function has yet developed in seven patients with average tumor diameters less than 10 mm. Radiosurgery is an important treatment alternative for selected acoustic neurinoma patients. 
7.Long-term potentiation of electrotonic coupling at mixed synapses. Long-term potentiation of chemical synapses is closely related to memory and learning. Studies of this process have concentrated on chemically mediated excitatory synapses. By contrast, activity-dependent modification of gap junctions, which also widely exist in higher structures such as hippocampus and neocortex, has not been described. Here we report that at mixed synapses between sensory afferents and an identified reticulospinal neuron, the electrotonic coupling potential can be potentiated, as well as the chemically mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential, for a prolonged time period using a stimulation paradigm like that which produces long-term potentiation in hippocampus. The effect on coupling is due to an increase in gap-junctional conductance. Our data indicate that the potentiation of both synaptic components requires an increase in intracellular calcium, involves activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, and is specific to the tetanized pathway. 
8.Evidence for platelet-activating factor as a novel mediator in experimental stroke in rabbits. Platelet-activating factor is a potent mediator of inflammation, which has untoward effects on cerebrovascular and neural elements. While several investigators have reported attenuation of ischemic damage after treatment with antagonists of platelet-activating factor, no study has proved endogenous production of platelet-activating factor in ischemia of the central nervous system. We hypothesized that endogenous production of platelet-activating factor participates in the early pathologic manifestations of deteriorating stroke. In 12 rabbits, we found tissue levels of platelet-activating factor measured by the release of serotonin from washed platelets to be elevated by approximately 20-fold in spinal cord injured by 25 minutes of ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion (2.80 +/- 0.98 ng/g) compared with that in normal spinal cord (0.15 +/- 0.06 ng/g, p less than 0.01). Given during ischemia to seven rabbits, 10 mg/kg i.p. of a highly selective and potent antagonist of platelet-activating factor (BN 50739) accentuated the early postischemic hyperemia and prevented the delayed hypoperfusion measured by on-line laser-Doppler flowmetry (-35 +/- 7% of baseline [n = 7] without versus 33 +/- 14% with treatment, p less than 0.01) and the edema formation measured as the increase in tissue water content (4.4 +/- 0.7% without [n = 6] versus 2.1 +/- 0.6% with [n = 7]treatment, p less than 0.05) after 2 hours of reperfusion. This neurochemical and pharmacologic evidence emphasizes a new perspective of ischemia-induced phospholipid degradation and suggests an important role for platelet-activating factor in the early manifestations of stroke. 
9.Follow-up results of balloon angioplasty of native coarctation in neonates and infants. The purpose of this study is to present intermediate-term results of balloon angioplasty of native aortic coarctation in neonates and infants less than 1 year of age. During a 60-month-period that ended in January 1990, 19 infants ages 3 days to 12 months (median, 2.5 months), underwent balloon angioplasty of native coarctation with resultant reduction in peak-to-peak systolic pressure gradient from 39 +/- 12 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 11 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and increase in coarctation segment size from 2.2 +/- 0.8 mm to 4.7 +/- 1.0 mm. None required immediate surgical intervention. Thirteen of the 19 (68%) had severe associated cardiac defects. There was one death (5%) 2 days after balloon angioplasty, and it was related to associated cardiac defect. One infant was lost to follow-up. It is too soon to restudy one infant. The remaining 16 infants had clinical (36 +/- 18 months) and catheterization (12 +/- 4 months) follow-up data. The residual coarctation gradient (22 +/- 15 mm Hg) and coarcted segment size (4.4 +/- 1.6 mm) remain improved (p less than 0.01) when compared with pre-balloon angioplasty values. Five of the 16 (31%) infants (four were neonates at the time of balloon angioplasty) had evidence for recoarctation (defined as gradient greater than 20 mm Hg) and underwent surgical resection (two) or repeat balloon angioplasty (three), all with success. None developed aneurysms. 
10.Carcinoma of the vulva. Clinicopathologic factors involved in inguinal and pelvic lymph node metastasis. Eighty-five women with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma were subjected to radical vulvectomy with bilateral inguinal and femoral node dissection or to radical vulvectomy with bilateral inguinofemoral and deep pelvic node dissection. The association between lymph node status (metastatic or not) and several parameters was analyzed: tumor location, size and clinical stage; tumor thickness, histologic grade and mitotic index; blood vessel, lymphatic and perineural infiltration; and lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrates. There were no metastases to the pelvic lymph nodes without previous inguinal lymph node involvement. Unilateral vulvar carcinomas did not have contralateral metastatic nodes when there was no ipsilateral nodal involvement. Lymphatic vessel infiltration showed a statistically significant correlation with inguinal node metastases (P less than .05). No correlation was found between lymph node metastasis and tumor size, clitoral invasion, tumor thickness, histologic grade, blood vessel and perineural infiltration, lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrates, and mitotic index.
