1.Studies of myocardial protection in the immature heart. II. Evidence for importance of amino acid metabolism in tolerance to ischemia. This study tests the importance of amino acid transamination in determining the tolerance of immature hearts to ischemic damage. Amino acid transamination was inhibited metabolically by pretreatment with aminooxyacetic acid. The aminooxyacetic acid dose and duration were determined by incubating in vitro tissue homogenate and showing that an 8 mmol/L AOA dose for 5 minutes blocked 90% of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity. Control studies in nonischemic hearts showed that coronary perfusion with aminooxyacetic acid for 5 minutes did not impair myocardial performance. In contrast, pretreatment of immature puppies with aminooxyacetic acid severely impaired recovery after 45 minutes of normothermic global ischemia (30% versus 85% recovery in untreated hearts, p less than 0.05). Biochemical analyses of hearts undergoing ischemia showed aminooxyacetic acid to limit lactate production, impair glutamate utilization, prevent alanine production, and limit succinate accumulation (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that amino acid transamination is an important adaptive process in the immature heart that improves its resistance to ischemic damage. 
2.Core temperature measurement in hypovolemic resuscitation. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Accurate core temperature measurement in severely hypovolemic patients can be difficult to achieve. We used a dog model to determine both a convenient method of measuring core temperature and the relative accuracy of the multiple sites. DESIGN: Prospective laboratory (animal model) study. SETTING: Operating suites in the Animal Care Department. PARTICIPANTS: Eight adult, anesthetized greyhound dogs. INTERVENTIONS: Continuous temperature monitoring by thermistors placed in the brain, central vein, tympanic membrane, bladder, rectum, esophagus, and subcutaneous tissue. Hemorrhage to 65% initial intravascular volume and autologous transfusion of cooled blood, during which serial temperature measurements were recorded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The readings were analyzed with Pearson's correlation coefficient. Brain temperature correlated very well with tympanic membrane temperature throughout the course (r = .869, P less than .0005). Rectum, bladder, and esophagus also correlated well with brain. Central venous temperature, however, correlated poorly with temperatures at all other sites, reflecting the marked swings in intravascular temperature caused by cold transfusion. These wide variations were damped at the other sites. The best correlation of central venous temperature was with brain and bladder, although tympanic membrane correlation was fair. CONCLUSIONS: Because intravascular hypothermia appears to be the source of the arrhythmias and hemostatic abnormalities often seen during the early resuscitation of hypovolemic patients, our results suggest bladder or tympanic membrane as the initial temperature site. After the initial resuscitation, end organ (eg, brain) temperature is the most important and is most accurately reflected by tympanic membrane temperature. 
3.Magnetic resonance imaging of facial nerve neuromas. Facial nerve neuromas are uncommon tumors often confused with other tumors of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle. Radiologically, it may be impossible to differentiate an intracanalicular facial nerve neuroma from an acoustic neuroma. We present three case reports of facial nerve neuromas arising within the internal auditory canal to show the important magnetic resonance imaging features of these tumors. One tumor extended into the cerebellopontine angle, middle cranial fossa, and middle ear. Another filled the internal auditory canal and extended through the cerebellopontine angle to the brain stem. The third occurred in a patient who had neurofibromatosis as well as numerous other intracranial tumors. We feel that gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging provides the most useful information in the preoperative assessment of this disorder. 
4.Protection from chemotherapy-induced alopecia in a rat model. Alopecia (hair loss) is among the most distressing side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Little progress has been made, however, in its prevention or treatment, partly because of the lack of suitable experimental model. In recent work on the treatment of myelogenous leukemia in the rat, the following observations were made: (i) treatment of 8-day-old rats with cytosine arabinoside consistently produced alopecia, and (ii) ImuVert, a biologic response modifier derived from the bacterium Serratia marcescens, uniformly produced complete protection against the alopecia. In subsequent experiments, both cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin also produced alopecia in this model, and the doxorubicin-induced alopecia was prevented by treatment with ImuVert. The potential relevance of these observations to chemotherapy-induced alopecia in the clinical setting should be examined. 
5.A phase II clinical trial of carboplatin infusion in high-risk acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. Carboplatin (CBDCA) is a second-generation platinum drug that has been shown to be useful when used as a continuous infusion in treatment of refractory adult leukemia. We report on the effectiveness of continuous infusion CBDCA, 300 mg/m2/d x 5 days, as evaluated in nine patients with secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) (seven previous myelodysplastic syndrome and two treatment-associated ANLL), three ANLL patients in first relapse, six refractory ANLL, and nine patients with blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (BP-CML). All patients were considered assessable. The response rate was 44% (eight complete remissions [CRs], four partial remissions [PRs]). Median duration of postchemotherapy neutropenia was 36 days (range, 18 to 45). Therapy was well tolerated, and toxicity was mainly hematologic and nondose-limiting. Despite prolonged neutropenia, severe infections were rarely seen, and most patients were managed as outpatients. Twelve patients had nausea and vomiting, two had symptomatic hypomagnesemia, and one patient showed reversible ototoxicity. Because of substantial antileukemic activity and unusual extrahematologic toxicity, CBDCA appears to be an effective second-line agent in the treatment of ANLL and should be considered for upgrading to first-line treatment regimens. 
6.Coronary flow and mental stress. Experimental findings. The hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, and coronary flow responses to a psychological test were studied in 13 pigs both in the absence (group 1, n = 8) and the presence (group 2, n = 5) of a transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The psychological test consisted of presenting food to a fasting but restrained animal for 3 minutes. In group 1, stress increased the heart rate from 128 +/- 5 to 176 +/- 8 beats/min (mean +/- SEM) and arterial pressure from 93 +/- 4 to 112 mm Hg. Comparing the individual increase in rate-pressure product with the increase in coronary conductance during the test, a parallel response was found in only two animals, whereas a relatively lower coronary conductance was observed in the remainder, suggesting vasoconstriction. Clinical signs of ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmias were never observed in this group of animals. Each group 2 animal underwent two occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery, randomly performed on separate days both in the presence and the absence of the food deprivation stress. When the latter was applied in the presence of occlusion, all animals developed ventricular fibrillation in less than 2 minutes (mean, 81.4 seconds). Conversely, only one animal had ventricular fibrillation when a 3-minute occlusion was performed without exposure to stress. This occurred despite the fact that more severe ischemia (as detected by an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreases in dP/dt and systolic pressure) was recorded at 3 minutes of occlusion. 
7.Diagnosis of chronic abacterial prostato-vesiculitis by rectal ultrasonography in relation to symptoms and findings. A group of 36 men with chronic abacterial prostato-vesiculitis, confirmed by semen analysis and rectal ultrasonography, underwent detailed anamnesis and clinical examination. There was no clear relationship between the severity of the symptoms or the presence of leucocytes and the extent of the changes visualised by ultrasound. In 72% of cases, clinical examination also revealed signs of a previous epididymitis. In general, asymmetry in symptoms could be related to glandular pathology, as indicated by ultrasonography, on the ipsilateral side. 
8.Predictors of cardiac survival after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. To assess the outcome of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and to determine the predictors of mortality, 73 patients with LV ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% who underwent initial PTCA were analyzed. The majority of patients had prior (greater than 1 week) myocardial infarction (62 patients, 85%). Congestive heart failure and unstable angina were present in 24 (45%) and 49 (67%) patients, respectively. Multivessel coronary artery disease was present in 60 (83%). The LV ejection fraction ranged from 14 to 40% (mean 34%). Intraaortic balloon pump (15%) and percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support (4%) was used infrequently. Angiographic success was obtained in 109 of 128 lesions (85%) attempted. Complete revascularization was obtained in 16 of 60 patients with clinical success. Procedure-related mortality was 5% (4 patients). All patients were followed from greater than or equal to 6 to less than or equal to 71 months (average 26). The estimated survival was 79 +/- 5%, 74 +/- 6%, 66 +/- 7% and 57 +/- 8% at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively. A Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of congestive heart failure, a lower LV ejection fraction and a higher myocardial jeopardy score for contractile myocardium were independent predictors of survival after PTCA in patients with LV dysfunction. In conclusion, a high-risk subset can be identified among patients with severe LV dysfunction who undergo PTCA. 
9.Arrhythmias in patients with CHF. Should they be treated? Ventricular arrhythmias are a major cause of death in patients with congestive heart failure. Dr Ellenbogen and his associates discuss the current thinking, based on recent studies, concerning use of antiarrhythmic agents to prevent sudden cardiac death in these patients. As they point out, the proper antiarrhythmic therapy may be crucial to long-term survival. 
10.Two distinct loci on the short arm of chromosome 16 are involved in myeloid leukemia. We report a case of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) M5 with the characteristic t(8;16)(p11;p13). The breakpoint in the short arm was regionally localized using nonradioactive in situ hybridization with a series of cosmids of chromosome 16. The results show that a difference exists between the breakpoint in chromosome 16(p13) in this t(8;16) and the breakpoint involved in the short arm in the characteristic inversion 16 (p13;q22)) that occurs in ANLL M4eo. Two different loci appear to be involved in these chromosomal rearrangements.
