Give downloadable output in CSV format, where the first column would be the note that I give as an input, and the second column will be one of the five categories associated with notes. Please do not write any explanations. 

Classify the following notes:
1.Cor triatriatum: clinical presentation and surgical results in 12 patients. Twelve patients with cor triatriatum have been seen at our institution since 1979. The clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and surgical results are outlined in this retrospective review. Operation is the treatment of choice for this rare congenital cardiac defect. One patient died 1 day before scheduled operation, and 2 patients died postoperatively, yielding a surgical mortality rate of 17% and an overall mortality rate of 25%. Resection of the obstructing atrial membrane was performed using hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in all cases. Left atriotomy was performed in 6 patients, and right atriotomy was performed in 7. The two postoperative deaths occurred in patients who had serious associated cardiac defects. Associated anomalies include atrial septal defect, persistent left superior vena cava, and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. The postoperative course has been excellent in all 9 surviving patients; all remain asymptomatic. Cor triatriatum is amenable to surgical repair with excellent results when diagnosed early and when not complicated by other severe cardiac anomalies. 
2.High or low hepaticojejunostomy for bile duct strictures? The 19 patients who underwent 22 postoperative repairs of bile duct stricture in our institution between 1973 and 1984 were evaluated to assess whether the recognition of the tenuous blood supply of the supraduodenal bile duct in 1979 had improved the results thereafter. Thirteen of these 22 operations followed a previous biliary tract repair; in 10 of the operations a low anastomosis had been performed without taking blood supply into account. Follow-up was complete and ranged from 5 to 15 years. There were no operative deaths and minimal morbidity. There were three deaths at a later time. Five of the 11 patients treated by surgery to 1979 had a clinically unsatisfactory result: recurrent strictures developed in all five patients. All but one of the eight patients receiving a high hepaticojejunostomy from 1980 had a clinically satisfactory result with no recurrent strictures. The one exception was the patient who had a second repair with separate high right and left hepatic duct anastomoses and who has ongoing symptoms from preexisting secondary sclerosing cholangitis. The results in the five high repairs performed for low strictures were particularly striking: All five were asymptomatic. This study lends support to the hypothesis of an ischemic basis for biliary strictures and to the recommendation that strictures be repaired with a high hepaticojejunostomy. 
3.Trends in thirty years of vaginal hysterectomy. Vaginal hysterectomy, as currently performed at the University of Vienna, was first described by Halban in 1932. From 1955 to 1985, a total of 9,967 hysterectomies were performed. The vaginal route was used for 6,078 (60.9 per cent) of these procedures. Sixty-four per cent of the women operated upon were multiparous, 27 per cent were uniparous and 8 per cent were nulliparous. A comparison of the periods 1955 to 1975 and 1976 to 1985 revealed the following trends: the incidence of uterine myomas (30.6 to 27.1 per cent), in situ carcinoma of the cervix (6.5 to 7.9 per cent) and endometrial carcinoma (1.4 to 0.6 per cent) remained largely constant. In the past decade, indications for positional abnormalities (uterine descent and prolapse) were encountered more often (27.6 to 41.6 per cent) than in the first observation period, while the incidence of recurrent metrorrhagia was found to decline (33.9 to 22.8 per cent). The most common complications included hemorrhage during the operation, lesions of the bladder, hemorrhage until 48 hours after surgical treatment and hemorrhage from days 2 to 14 postoperatively (around 0.5 per cent, respectively). During the second observation period, no postoperative fistulas developed. Two instances of tubal prolapse were seen. Laparotomy was done in four of 6,078 instances. Two patients died of septic complications. Whenever possible, we prefer vaginal hysterectomy because of its low complication rate, low mortality rate and low postoperative morbidity. 
4.Similar frequencies of renin gene restriction fragment length polymorphisms in hypertensive and normotensive subjects. A prospective study was conducted to compare the frequency of renin gene polymorphisms in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Hypertensive (n = 102, blood pressure 168 +/- 17/103 +/- 9 mm Hg) and normotensive (n = 120, blood pressure 122 +/- 10/75 +/- 9 mm Hg) subjects were white, had similar age and sex distributions (hypertensive group, 45 +/- 10 years old and 52% female; normotensive group, 44 +/- 9 years old and 55% female) and similar body mass index (hypertensive group, 23.2 +/- 2.6; normotensive group, 22.5 +/- 2.4 kg/m2, p = 0.048). The familial susceptibility to hypertension was defined as at least one parent and one sibling who were hypertensive before age 65; subjects in the normotensive group had no familial history of hypertension. Renin gene polymorphisms located throughout the renin gene were identified by using three restriction enzymes (Taq I, HinfI, HindIII). For each polymorphic restriction site, allele frequencies were similar in the hypertensive and the normotensive groups. In the absence of parental genotypes, the haplotype frequencies combining the three restriction fragment length polymorphisms were estimated by using maximum likelihood techniques and were similar in both groups (hypertensive group, 0.429, 0.277, and 0.177; normotensive group, 0.453, 0.245, and 0.195 for the three most common haplotypes). A rare haplotype detected by Taq I/Hind III was apparently more frequent in the hypertensive than in the normotensive group (hypertensive group, tH 0.086, th 0.022; normotensive group, tH 0.038, th 0.050), but the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, no association between renin gene polymorphisms and essential hypertension was demonstrated in the present study. 
5.Cerebral glucose utilization during sleep in Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a PET study. Three right-handed male children (aged 5, 6, and 11 years) with signs, symptoms and/or history of the syndrome of acquired aphasia-epilepsy (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) were studied during drug-induced, electroencephalographically (EEG)-monitored sleep by positron-emission tomography (PET) and the [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) method. Our data demonstrate that in Landau-Kleffner syndrome, cerebral glucose utilization is not normal during sleep. The metabolic pattern varied between the children but the metabolic disturbances always predominated over the temporal lobes. They were right-sided, left-sided, or bilateral. In the two first patients, EEG recordings showed continuous spike-and-wave discharges during sleep and a right-greater-than-left asymmetry was observed in temporal areas. In patient 1, the asymmetry was associated with a relative increase of glucose utilization of the right posterior temporal region. In patient 2, the glucose utilization was relatively decreased in the left anterotemporal and left perisylvian regions. In patient 3, the sleep EEG showed no discharge and no significant asymmetry was observed; however, glucose utilization of both temporal lobes was decreased. Lower metabolic rates in subcortical structures than in cortex were also noted in the three children. This metabolic pattern may be related to the maturation of the central nervous system (CNS). 
6.Collateral circulation in Kawasaki disease with coronary occlusion or severe stenosis. Forty patients with Kawasaki disease with severe coronary sequelae were investigated. All had at least a 90% reduction in the diameter of the major coronary artery. Collateral vessels were seen in 32 of 33 (97%) patients with total occlusion. All patients with severe stenosis but not total occlusion had no or poorly developed collateral vessels. Analysis according to the presence or absence of collateral vessels showed no significant differences in the results of treadmill stress testing and myocardial imaging between these two groups. In patients treated surgically, the abnormalities recognized by these tests were normalized or improved when the bypass was patent. These data indicate that collateral circulation in patients with Kawasaki disease cannot be seen angiographically unless there is total occlusion and the presence of collateral circulation cannot provide protection against stress-induced myocardial ischemia. 
7.Widespread functional effects of discrete thalamic infarction. In order to investigate functional effects of various thalamic structures on metabolism in remote, morphologically intact cerebral regions, we used positron emission tomography of (18F)-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to study regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (rCMRGlu) in 11 patients with chronic unilateral or bilateral infarcts strictly confined to the thalamus. Patients were grouped according to computed tomographic scans showing anterior (three), medial (four), or posterior (four) lesions. Compared with a matched group of 11 healthy subjects (hemispheric CMRGlu 35.2 +/- 3.49 mumol/100 g per minute), glucose metabolism was significantly lower in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the infarction (31.2 +/- 2.97 mumol/100 g per minute). Patients with bilateral infarcts had lower hemispheric CMRGlu (29.9 +/- 2.74 mumol/100 g per minute) than those with unilateral lesions (32.2 +/- 2.97 mumol/100 g per minute). Depending on infarct location within the thalamus, there was differential depression of rCMRGlu, with the largest effects on frontal and occipital areas in medial infarctions. Except for ipsilateral thalamic deactivation, metabolic patterns with anterior thalamic infarcts were close to normal, while posterior infarcts mostly depressed rCMRGlu in the visual and in the inferior limbic cortex. Cerebellar metabolic rates were within normal limits in most cases. These patterns of regional cerebral deactivation may be related to categories of thalamic projections--intrathalamic, to limbic system and basal ganglia, diffuse to most cortical areas, and specific to defined neocortical areas. Even small brain lesions may have widespread functional sequelae, potentially demonstrable by positron emission tomography. 
8.Alcoholics and liver transplantation. The Ethics and Social Impact Committee of the Transplant and Health Policy Center. Two arguments underlie a widespread unwillingness to consider patients with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver as candidates for transplantation. First, alcoholics are morally blameworthy, their condition the result of their own misconduct; such blameworthiness disqualifies alcoholics in unavoidable competition for organs with others who are equally sick but blameless. Second, because of their habits, alcoholics will not exhibit satisfactory rates of survival after transplantation; good stewardship of a scarce lifesaving resource therefore requires that alcoholics not be considered for liver transplantation. These arguments are carefully analyzed and shown to be defective. There is not good moral or medical reason for categorically precluding alcoholics as candidates for liver transplantation. It would, in addition, be unjust to implement such a preclusion simply because others might respond negatively if we do not. 
9.Felodipine in the treatment of hypertensive type II diabetics: effect on glucose homeostasis. The effect of felodipine on glucose tolerance was evaluated in 18 male type II diabetic patients treated with diet alone, who were hypertensive despite beta-blocker treatment. The study was a double-bind cross-over comparison of placebo and felodipine in addition to beta-blockade. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at randomization and at the end of each 4-week double-blind treatment period. The doses of felodipine given were 5 mg b.i.d. for 2 weeks followed by 10 mg b.i.d. for a further 2 weeks. Blood pressure was significantly reduced during felodipine treatment, whereas heart rate remained unaltered. HbA1c and fasting insulin levels did not change during the treatment periods. Fasting and maximal blood glucose levels were not altered between any of the treatment periods. However, there was a small but statistically significant increase (median increase 4%) in the area under the glucose concentration vs. time curve after felodipine as compared to placebo treatment. This increase was not considered to be clinically significant in the short term, but the finding merits further investigation in a rigorous long-term study. 
10.Mechanisms of gallstone formation in women. Effects of exogenous estrogen (Premarin) and dietary cholesterol on hepatic lipid metabolism. Our aim was to define mechanisms whereby conjugated estrogens (Premarin, exogenous estrogen; Ayerst Laboratories, New York) increase the risk of developing cholesterol gallstones and to determine the role, if any, of dietary cholesterol. We studied gallbladder motor function, biliary lipid composition and secretion, cholesterol absorption, cholesterol synthesis and esterification by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the clearance of chylomicron remnants, and bile acid kinetics in 29 anovulatory women. 13 were studied on both a low (443 +/- 119 mumol/d) and high (2,021 +/- 262 mumol/d) cholesterol diet. Premarin increased the lithogenic index of bile (P less than 0.05), increased biliary cholesterol secretion (P less than 0.005), lowered chenodeoxycholate (CDCA) pool (P less than 0.001) and synthesis (P less than 0.05), altered biliary bile acid composition [( CA + DCA]/CDCA increases, P less than 0.005), stimulated cholesterol esterification (P less than 0.03), and enhanced the clearance of chylomicron remnants (P = 0.07). Increases in dietary cholesterol stimulated the biliary secretion of cholesterol (P = 0.07), bile acid (P less than 0.05), phospholipid (P = 0.07), and as a result, did not alter lithogenic index. The reduction in CDCA pool and synthesis by Premarin was reversed by increasing dietary cholesterol. Off Premarin, only 24% of the increase in cholesterol entering the body in the diet was recovered as biliary cholesterol or newly synthesized bile acid. On Premarin, 68% of this increase in cholesterol was recovered as these biliary lipids. We conclude that Premarin increases biliary cholesterol by enhancing hepatic lipoprotein uptake and inhibiting bile acid synthesis. These actions of Premarin divert dietary cholesterol into bile.
