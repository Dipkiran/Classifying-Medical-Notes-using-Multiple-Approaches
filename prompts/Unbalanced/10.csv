Classify the following notes:
1.Effects of treadmill exercise to exhaustion on the insulin response to hyperglycemia in untrained men. The effects of a single bout of exercise to exhaustion on pancreatic insulin secretion were determined in seven untrained men by use of a 3-h hyperglycemic clamp with plasma glucose maintained at 180 mg/100 ml. Clamps were performed either 12 h after an intermittent treadmill run at approximately 77% maximum O2 consumption or without prior exercise. Arterialized blood samples for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide determination were obtained from a heated hand vein. The peak insulin response during the early phase (0-10 min) of the postexercise clamp was higher (81 +/- 8 vs. 59 +/- 9 microU/ml; P less than 0.05) than in the nonexercise clamp. Incremental areas under the insulin (376 +/- 33 vs. 245 +/- 51 microU.ml-1.min) and C-peptide (17 +/- 2 vs. 12 +/- 1 ng.ml-1.min) curves were also greater (P less than 0.05) during the early phase of the postexercise clamp. No differences were observed in either insulin concentrations or whole body glucose disposal during the late phase (15-180 min). Area under the C-peptide curve was greater during the late phase of the postexercise clamp (650 +/- 53 vs. 536 +/- 76 ng.ml-1.min, P less than 0.05). The exercise bout induced muscle soreness and caused an elevation in plasma creatine kinase activity (142 +/- 32 vs. 305 +/- 31 IU/l; P less than 0.05) before the postexercise clamp. We conclude that in untrained men a bout of running to exhaustion increased pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion during the early phase of the hyperglycemic clamp. Increased insulin secretion during the late phase of the clamp appeared to be compensated by increased insulin clearance. 
2.Can nurses perform surgical cricothyrotomy with acceptable success and complication rates? STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine whether flight nurses can perform surgical cricothyrotomies with acceptable success and complication rates. METHODS: This case series examined the survival, success, and complication rates of surgical cricothyrotomy. A specially trained flight nurse retrospectively reviewed all prehospital, emergency department, inpatient, autopsy, and outpatient follow-up records. RESULTS: Fifty-five consecutive patients in whom surgical cricothyrotomy was attempted by a flight nurse during a two-and-one-half-year period were studied. Patients ranged in age from 9 to 76 years. The airway was not cannulated successfully by a flight nurse in two patients. In two patients, the tube was not in the cricothyroid space (one in the upper tracheal rings, and the other in the larynx). In three patients, packing was insufficient to stop bleeding from around the operative site; and in three the tube became occluded by blood in the emergency department. Finally, two patients developed subglottic stenosis. CONCLUSION: Surgical cricothyrotomy in the field can be performed reliably by specially trained nurses. Because only the most critically ill or injured patients with unmanageable airways are subjected to this procedure, a significant complication rate can be anticipated. 
3.Direct extension of laryngeal carcinoma to the skin of the neck. Invasion of the skin of the neck by laryngeal carcinoma is relatively uncommon. Twelve cases of cancer of the larynx fungating through the cervical skin are presented. They mostly followed initial treatment by deep X-ray therapy or partial laryngectomy. A high tracheostomy was also considered to be a contributing cause for the occurrence of such a mishap. The management and follow-up of these patients is described. 
4.Laryngeal metastasis from colonic adenocarcinoma. Metastases to the larynx from distant primaries are very rare. Usually the secondary lesion comes from an hypernephroma or malignant melanoma. A case of metastatic laryngeal tumour from a colonic adenocarcinoma, occurring in a 59-year-old woman, is presented and the routes for laryngeal spread are discussed. The poor survival-rate of these patients justified only conservative surgery. 
5.Gene rearrangements in the diagnosis of lymphoma/leukemia. Guidelines for use based on a multiinstitutional study. The demonstration of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements in human lymphoproliferative processes with the use of DNA hybridization has gained great popularity as a sensitive laboratory adjunct to diagnostic hematopathology. The fact that nearly all B- or T-cell malignant lymphomas and leukemias have one or more rearranged antigen receptor genes provides a biologic basis for a diagnostic test. To formally analyze the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of gene rearrangements in the diagnosis of human lymphoproliferative disease, the authors conducted a large, multiinstitutional study. Through a blinded, controlled approach, gene rearrangement analysis of 275 cases was shown to carry a high correlation with conventional phenotyping and histologic diagnosis, with only minor false-positive and false-negative rates. Significantly, no rearrangements were detected in normal lymphoid tissues or carcinomas, sarcomas, or melanomas. In a randomized study of 50 cases, laboratory results showed a high rate of interlaboratory agreement, regardless of the level of previous experience. Furthermore, the reproducibility of interpretation of data (Southern blot autoradiograms) of 192 cases showed high concordance among 11 observers from multiple laboratories. Based on these findings, the authors propose a set of guidelines for interpretation of gene rearrangement analysis that, if carefully followed, renders this a highly reproducible, safe, and accurate addition to the diagnostic regimen for human lymphoproliferative processes. 
6.Young-onset Parkinson's disease: a clinical review. Young-onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD) is arbitrarily defined as that which produces initial symptoms between the ages of 21 and 39, inclusive. The special problems and concerns of the patient with YOPD present as much of a challenge and opportunity for the clinician as the disease itself does for the researcher. In contrast to juvenile parkinsonism, which is a heterogeneous group of clinicopathologic entities presenting (also arbitrarily) before age 21, YOPD appears to be the same nosologic entity as older-onset PD. It comprises approximately 5% of referral populations in Western countries and about 10% in Japan. Its annual incidence relative to the population at risk is about 1/10 that of PD at age sixty. YOPD tends to have more gradual progression of parkinsonian signs and symptoms, earlier appearance of levodopa-related dyskinesias and levodopa-dose-related motor fluctuations, and frequent presence of dystonia as an early or presenting sign. Studies conflict with regard to the suspected greater familial frequency and lesser frequency of dementia than in older-onset PD. 
7.Long-term impact of smoking cessation on the incidence of coronary heart disease. Using a simulation model of the US male population, we estimated the long-term impact that future smoking cessation programs would have on the distribution and occurrence of coronary heart disease in males ages 35-84. For interventions that reduce the number of smokers by 25 percent in 1990, the number of men free of coronary heart disease is projected to increase by 416,787 (0.7 percent) in 2015, and the age-standardized absolute incidence to decline by 2.3 percent. Incidence rates and absolute incidences are projected to fall in men under age 65, but absolute incidence would rise in men over age 65, in large part because of the increased number of men who were at risk for coronary heart disease because of a reduction in non-coronary smoking-related mortality. These trends were more marked for greater smoking reductions and were generally unaffected in a variety of analyses using alternative assumptions, which considered smoking as a risk factor in the elderly, a lag-time before benefits from smoking cessation were realized and secular declines in smoking prevalence. Subject to the assumptions of our model, we conclude that smoking reductions will markedly reduce coronary heart disease, especially in younger age groups, and that this benefit will be slightly offset by a small increase in absolute incidence in elderly men. 
8.The role of carotid screening before coronary artery bypass. Five hundred thirty-nine patients with no symptoms of cerebral ischemia undergoing coronary artery bypass were preoperatively evaluated for presence of carotid stenosis by noninvasive methods (duplex scanning and ocular pneumoplethysmography-Gee). Overall prevalence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% was higher (8.7%) than that generally reported. Age greater than 60 years was significantly related to presence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% (11.3% vs 3.8%, p = 0.003). Risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking were not predictive for carotid stenosis, postoperative stroke, or death. Carotid stenosis greater than 75% (odds ratio 9.87, p less than 0.005) and coronary artery bypass redo (odds ratio 5.26, p less than 0.05) were both independent predictors of stroke risk. Patients were divided into four groups: group 1, minimal or mild degree of carotid stenosis (less than 50%), not submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (432 patients, 80.1%); group 2, moderate degree of stenosis (50% to 75%), no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (60 patients, 11.2%); group 3, severe carotid stenosis; (greater than 75%), submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (19 patients, 3.5%), group 4, severe carotid stenosis (greater than 75%) no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (28 patients, 5.2%). Patients in group 4 had significantly higher stroke rate (14.3%) compared to the other three groups (1.1%) (p = 0.0019). The finding of carotid stenosis greater than 75% in patients over 60 years of age was associated with occurrence of stroke in 15% of cases. Carotid screening is helpful to determine patients at increased risk of stroke and should be performed in patients greater than 60 years. 
9.Prognostic significance of valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis. PURPOSE: Doppler ultrasound is a sensitive modality for detecting and quantitating valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis. Because valvular regurgitation leads to heart failure, we evaluated the prognostic significance of Doppler-detected valvular regurgitation in patients with endocarditis who had not yet developed clinical heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 65 patients with a clinical diagnosis of infective endocarditis from May 1985 to March 1990. A total of 49 patients were included in the study: 33 patients with native valve endocarditis and 16 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. The initial Doppler echocardiogram was examined in these patients to determine the presence and degree of valvular regurgitation. RESULTS: Significant (moderate to severe) valvular regurgitation was detected in 23 (47%) patients. The presence or absence of significant valvular regurgitation did not predict the development of congestive heart failure, the need for surgery, or death (p = NS). The development of congestive heart failure was significantly associated with the need for surgery (p less than 0.0001) and death (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the detection of significant valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis who have not yet developed heart failure is not predictive of future complications nor does the absence of significant valvular regurgitation identify a group of patients with a more favorable prognosis. In our series, patients who developed congestive heart failure had a significantly higher incidence of surgery and death. Therefore, decisions regarding clinical management in patients with infective endocarditis should not be made solely on the presence or absence of echocardiographically detected valvular regurgitation. 
10.Survival in patients with large-bowel cancer. A population-based investigation from the Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. Five-year survival data were obtained in 97 percent or 1105 of 1140 new patients with histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma during a 12-month period in 1981 and 1982, as part of a large comprehensive population-based study of colorectal cancer incidence, etiology, and survival, The Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. Fifteen percent of patients were Dukes' A stage, 32 percent were Dukes' B, 25 percent were Dukes' C, and 29 percent were Dukes' D. At five years after diagnosis, the observed survival rate was 36 percent and the adjusted rate was 42 percent. Dukes' staging was a highly discriminating factor in survival (P less than 0.001). Survival rates were better in women than in men and better for patients with colon cancer than for patients with rectal cancer. Survival by Dukes' staging was not affected by colon subsite or by the tumor being the first and single tumor, metachronous tumor, or synchronous tumor. The survival of younger patients was better for Dukes' stages A, B, and C, and worse for Dukes' D. Survival was worse in the presence of bowel perforation in Dukes' C and D stages. Within Dukes' D (incurable cases), survival was best in the absence of hepatic metastases, slightly worse when only hepatic metastases were present, and poorest in the presence of both hepatic and extrahepatic metastases. Statistical modeling of survival determinants other than staging indicated that cell differentiation had the largest effect (survival decreasing with poor cell differentiation), followed by site (survival worse for rectal cancer than colon cancer), then age (survival better for younger patients), while bowel perforation had the smallest effect on survival.
