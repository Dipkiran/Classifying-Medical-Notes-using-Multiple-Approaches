You are a health professional, and you are classifying medical notes in one of the five categories: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, and general pathological conditions. 

Give downloadable output in CSV format, where the first column would be the note that I give as an input, and the second column will be one of the five categories associated with notes. Please do not write any explanations. 

Classify the following notes:
1.Salvage from cardiogenic shock by atherectomy after failed emergency coronary artery angioplasty. In this case report of a patient undergoing angioplasty for cardiogenic shock during acute myocardial infarction, recurrent occlusion resulted in recurrence of shock. Atherectomy reestablished lasting patency and reversed the patient's hemodynamic collapse. Atherectomy deserves further investigation as a means to salvage vessel patency during unsuccessful coronary angioplasty. 
2.Immunopathology of diabetes in the RT6-depleted diabetes-resistant BB/Wor rat. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus appears to be an autoimmune disease that is characterized morphologically by insulitis, an inflammation of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans that results in the destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells. The RT6-depleted DR rat provides a good model for the in situ study of insulitis. The authors used the anti-RT6.1 monoclonal antibody to selectively deplete RT6 T cells in DR rats and produce a synchronous and rapid development of insulitis that commences 10 days after treatment. The phenotype of cells that infiltrated the islets at different stages of insulitis in the RT6-depleted DR rat was determined by immunocytochemical techniques. A prodromal period of 10 days was present in which the authors could not detect morphologic alterations within the pancreas. This is followed by a second phase of early insulitis in which a few islets are infiltrated by macrophages and T cells. This rapidly progresses by 18 days to the final phase of generalized insulitis in which the islets are massively infiltrated by macrophages and T cells. 
3.Use of plasmid profiles in the investigation of a patient with Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease. Plasmids may effect bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance, and serve as epidemiologic markers. In this study, plasmid DNA profiles of serial isolates of Helicobacter pylori showed persistence of an identical strain of this organism in a patient with duodenal ulcer disease. Three control strains of H. pylori isolated from other patients contained plasmids different from each other and from that of the original patient; two of these strains had two plasmids each. These data have important implications for further study of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of H. pylori-related diseases. 
4.Remission induction and continuation therapy in children with their first relapse of acute lymphoid leukemia. A Pediatric Oncology Group study. Between January 1979 and April 1983, 113 children undergoing their first relapse of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) at any site were registered in Pediatric Oncology Group study 7834; 98 were eligible and evaluable. In addition to radiotherapy administered to sites of local relapse, induction consisted of vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VAP) chemotherapy. Continuation therapy consisted of triple-drug intrathecal therapy and regimens of 6-thioguanine and cytarabine alternating with vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and cytarabine. Randomization in continuation was between VAP pulses or no pulse, regardless of the site of relapse. This report provides long-term follow-up of these patients. Thirty-two of 39 children with bone marrow involvement achieved a complete response (CR). Only one of these is alive in an unmaintained remission, a child who did not have an initial CR. Thirty-four of 36 evaluable children with central nervous system involvement as the site of relapse achieved CR. Of these ten are alive; eight are in continuing CR. Nineteen of 20 boys with testicular relapse achieved CR. Of these, 14 are still alive and not receiving therapy, although only one half received treatment in compliance with the protocol described. These results illustrate the possibility of cure of patients who have relapsed with ALL when it is (1) confined to a meningeal or gonadal site and (2) treated vigorously with radiotherapy and a new regimen of systemic chemotherapy. The results reconfirm the need to prevent an initial relapse at any site. 
5.Prevalence of ulcerative colitis in the Israeli kibbutz population. We carried out an epidemiological study of ulcerative colitis in 279 Israeli kibbutzim (121,403 population). The prevalence on December 31, 1987 was 121.08 per 100,000 population. When the data were stratified according to ethnic groups, the highest point prevalence was found in Israeli-born Jews (220.56 per 100,000 population), more than in Asian-African-born, or European-American-born kibbutz members (139.20 and 78.73 cases per 100,000 population, respectively). There were 68 men and 78 women (ratio of 0.87). The average age of the patients in the year of this survey was 46 years; it was 35 years at the time of diagnosis. Proctitis was found in 57%, left-sided colitis in 12%, and substantial or total colitis in 31%. Relapse at pregnancy was demonstrated in seven patients, and remission in one. Family history of a first-degree relative with inflammatory bowel disease was documented in three patients (2%). Probable complications of ulcerative colitis were observed in 38 (26%), anemia in 13 (9%). One patient (0.7%) with rectal cancer, also had breast cancer. We suggest that the impressive increase in ulcerative colitis prevalence among Israeli and Asian-African-born, in comparison with European-American-born kibbutz members, points toward a role of environmental factors in the etiology of this disease. 
6.Medical treatment of esophageal achalasia. Double-blind crossover study with oral nifedipine, verapamil, and placebo Calcium channel blockers have been previously shown to decrease lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and improve symptoms in achalasia. We performed a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study to assess the effects of oral nifedipine and verapamil on LES pressure, amplitude of esophageal body contraction, and clinical symptomatology in eight patients with symptomatic achalasia diagnosed by endoscopy, barium swallow, and manometry. Patients were randomized to receive up to 20 mg nifedipine, 160 mg verapamil, or placebo and underwent esophageal manometry before (baseline) and after four weeks on each drug. Diary cards were kept to record and grade symptoms and drug plasma level determinations were correlated with manometric and clinical findings. Both nifedipine and verapamil caused a statistically significant decrease in mean LES pressure, but only nifedipine caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of contractions of the smooth muscle portion of the esophagus. No statistically significant differences in the overall clinical symptomatology were noted with any of the drugs, although some individual improvements in dysphagia and chest pain were noted. We conclude that, despite the reduction in LES pressure and contraction amplitude of the distal esophageal body, oral nifedipine and verapamil do not significantly alter the clinical symptomatology of patients with achalasia. 
7.The human immunodeficiency virus type 2 vpr gene is essential for productive infection of human macrophages. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genetic determinant(s) responsible for tropism in human T cells or macrophages are not well defined. We studied the role of the HIV type 2 (HIV-2) nef and vpr genes in viral tropism. HIV-2 mutants, lacking either vpr or nef genes, or both vpr and nef, were obtained by site-specific mutagenesis of a biologically active HIV-2 proviral clone (HIV-2sbl/isy), which is infectious in both human T cells and macrophages. Viral progeny carrying mutations of nef, vpr, or of both nef and vpr genes replicated more efficiently than the parental virus in primary human peripheral blood cells and in the human Hut 78 T-cell line. In contrast, the HIV-2 nef- mutant infected human macrophages as efficiently as the parental virus, whereas viruses lacking the vpr gene either alone or in conjunction with the lack of the nef gene did not replicate in macrophages. Thus, some lack of nef in HIV-2 enhances viral replication in T cells and does not interfere with viral replication in primary macrophages, whereas vpr is essential for replication of HIV-2 in human macrophages. Because the parental HIV-2sbl/isy cloned virus also infects rhesus macaques, the use in animal studies of these HIV-2 mutants with differences in cell tropism and rates of replication will be highly useful in understanding the mechanism of viral infectivity and possibly pathogenicity in vivo. 
8.A limited diagnostic investigation for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Oximetry and static charge sensitive bed. A simplified sleep apnea investigation consisting of combined oximetry and respiration movement monitoring was compared with conventional polysomnography. These two types of recordings were performed simultaneously during one night in 77 patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). A static charge sensitive bed (SCSB) was used in the simplified recording because it provides a comfortable and reliable means of recording respiration movements. Periods of obstructive apneas gave a diamond-shaped periodic respiration movement pattern in the SCSB, usually accompanied by repetitive oxygen desaturations. The average number of desaturations greater than or equal to 4 percent per sleeping hour was termed the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and compared with the apnea index (AI). In the whole population they were well correlated (p less than 0.0001, R2 = 0.41), but in individual cases there were considerable discrepancies. Patients with periodic respiration movements less than 18 percent of total sleeping time and ODI less than 2 never had AI greater than or equal to 5, whereas patients with periodic respiration greater than 45 percent and ODI greater than 6 always had AI greater than or equal to 5. Fifty-one of the 77 patients fulfilled these criteria. A bradycardia response to apneas was absent in 29 percent of patients with AI greater than or equal to 5. A combination of respiration movement and oximetry recording thus seems to give sufficient information to confirm or negate a diagnosis of OSAS in a majority of patients with clinical symptoms. In borderline patients, further investigations should be performed. 
9.Retroviral transduction of protein kinase C-gamma into cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones leads to immortalization with retention of specific function. The molecular pathways that are responsible for delivering the proliferative signals from the cell surface to the nucleus in T lymphocytes are still unresolved, but recent data implicates protein kinase C (PKC) involvement in the TCR signaling pathway. To further address the role of PKC in T cell activation, the effects of high level expression of the PKC-gamma isoenzyme in murine CTL clones were examined. Unlike the parental cells that required periodic Ag stimulation for cell activation and growth, cells expressing a retrovirally transduced PKC-gamma gene propagated in culture independent of the need for Ag stimulation, although maintaining identical functional specificity to the parental CTL. Constitutive PKC-gamma expression may therefore mimic physiologic PKC activation, thereby abrogating the requirement for TCR-Ag interaction in T cell activation. 
10.Immediate and follow-up results of balloon angioplasty of postoperative recoarctation in infants and children. The purpose of this article is to present immediate and follow-up results of balloon angioplasty of aortic recoarctations following previous surgery in infants and children. During a 45-month period that ended in June 1989, nine infants and children, ages 6 months to 7 years, underwent balloon angioplasty of recoarctation with resultant reduction in peak-to-peak systolic pressure gradient from 52 +/- 20 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 16 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and increase in coarctation segment size from 3.4 +/- 1.4 mm to 6.1 +/- 1.6 mm (p less than 0.01). None required surgical intervention. There were no significant complications. Follow-up catheterization (16 +/- 7 months) data in six children and follow-up clinical (17 +/- 6 months) data in all children were available for review. Both the residual coarctation pressure gradient (6 +/- 6 mm Hg) and coarctation segment size (8.2 +/- 2.4 mm) remain improved (p less than 0.001) when compared with pre-balloon angioplasty values and the pressure gradient fell further (p less than 0.01) when compared with that measured immediately after balloon angioplasty. None developed restenosis, although one child required surgical relief of severe narrowing of isthmus of the aortic arch. None developed aneurysms. On the basis of this experience and that reported in the literature and because of high morbidity and mortality rates associated with repeat surgery for postoperative recoarctation, we recommend balloon angioplasty as the procedure of choice for relief of postoperative recoarctation with significant hypertension.
