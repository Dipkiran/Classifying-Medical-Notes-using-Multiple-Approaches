Give downloadable output in CSV format, where the first column would be the note that I give as an input, and the second column will be one of the five categories associated with notes. Please do not write any explanations. 
 
Use the examples to learn more about the five categories: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, 
and general pathological conditions. Here are the two examples of each categories:

1 Category: general pathological conditions. Medical Notes: Pulmonary arterial and venous constriction during hypoxia in 3- to 5-wk-old and adult ferrets. We have determined the sites of hypoxic vasoconstriction in ferret lungs. Lungs of five 3- to 5-wk-old and five adult ferrets were isolated and perfused with blood. Blood flow was adjusted initially to keep pulmonary arterial pressure at 20 cmH2O and left atrial and airway pressures at 6 and 8 cmH2O, respectively (zone 3). Once adjusted, flow was kept constant throughout the experiment. In each lung, pressures were measured in subpleural 20- to 50-microns-diam arterioles and venules with the micropipette servo-nulling method during normoxia (PO2 approximately 100 Torr) and hypoxia (PO2 less than 50 Torr). In normoxic adult ferret lungs, approximately 40% of total vascular resistance was in arteries, approximately 40% was in microvessels, and approximately 20% was in veins. With hypoxia, the total arteriovenous pressure drop increased by 68%. Arterial and venous pressure drops increased by 92 and 132%, respectively, with no change in microvascular pressure drop. In 3- to 5-wk-old ferret lungs, the vascular pressure profile during normoxia and the response to hypoxia were similar to those in adult lungs. We conclude that, in ferret lungs, arterial and venous resistances increase equally during hypoxia, resulting in increased microvascular pressures for fluid filtration. 
2 Category: general pathological conditions. Medical Notes: Pars plana vitrectomy for acute retinal detachment in penetrating ocular injuries. We studied 41 eyes with acute retinal detachment after penetrating ocular trauma in a retrospective cohort analysis. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed in 28 eyes, while the remaining 13 eyes had only primary repair and closure of the wound. The two groups differed in the type of trauma (more gunshot wounds in the vitrectomy group and more blunt injuries in the nonvitrectomized group). Visual success (visual acuity of 5/200 or better) was observed in 10 (37%) of the eyes treated by vitrectomy compared with one (8%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group. Anatomic success was achieved in 21 (75%) of the eyes in the vitrectomy group but in only one (8%) of those in the nonvitrectomy group. Enucleation or phthisis was observed in seven (54%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group compared with only five (18%) in the vitrectomy group. Significant prognostic factors for anatomic outcome in the vitrectomy group were the location of the laceration and the presence of the lens. 
3 Category: neoplasms. Medical Notes: Resection and reconstruction for bone tumors in the proximal tibia. The proximal tibia is a common site for both benign and malignant tumors. This article reviews pertinent anatomy, clinical presentation, and staging methods for tumors of this area. Discussion is given to various methods of resection and reconstruction with useful guidelines for procedure selection. The use of allografts for reconstruction is discussed in depth. 
4 Category: neoplasms. Medical Notes: Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration of retroperitoneal lymph nodes in gynecologic oncology. Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed on 30 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 29 patients with gynecologic cancer. There were no serious complications. Review of the cytologic material demonstrated malignant cells in 83% of the aspirates. Because the predictive value of a positive aspirate approaches 100%, therapy for metastatic disease can be initiated in these patients with the need for an open biopsy. Among five aspirates in which malignant cells were not seen, the cellularity of the specimen appeared to be the critical factor determining the predictive value of the aspirate. Whereas neither of two patients with negative aspirates of adequate cellularity has developed recurrent disease, two of three patients with hypocellular negative aspirates have. Because a hypocellular negative aspirate from a retroperitoneal lymph node may not be a true reflection of disease status, either repeat aspiration or open biopsy is advisable. 
5 Category: digestive system diseases. Medical Notes: Simultaneous bilateral hernia repair. A case against conventional wisdom. The timing of bilateral hernia repair remains controversial. Because of reported high recurrence rates after simultaneous bilateral repair, staged procedures have been suggested. This study determined recurrence and complication rates of unilateral versus simultaneous bilateral repair. Of 659 patients undergoing hernia repair between 1974 and 1980, 333 underwent unilateral repair and 329 had simultaneous bilateral repair. More than 90% of patients were followed until death or a minimum of 60 months (median, 104 months). Perioperative complications were associated with 18% of repairs. More morbidity occurred in the bilateral group. However complication rates for specific events were not significantly different, except for urinary retention, which occurred in 20 patients (6.1%) of the unilateral group and 49 (15%) of the bilateral group (p less than 0.001). Overall 25 recurrences occurred in the unilateral group and 31 in the bilateral group. Recurrence rates at 5 and 9 years were, respectively, 4.8% and 8.8% in the unilateral group and 5.0% and 9.1% in the bilateral group (p = 0.861). These data suggest that simultaneous bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy does not result in increased rates of most postoperative complications or recurrence when compared with unilateral repair. 
6 Category: digestive system diseases. Medical Notes: Mucosal injury and gamma-irradiation produce persistent gastric ulcers in the rabbit. Evaluation of antiulcer drug binding to experimental ulcer sites. A method producing persistent gastric ulcers in the rhesus monkey by combined mucosal injury and gamma-irradiation was modified and evaluated in the rabbit. gamma-Irradiation (800-1000 cGy) immediately after removal of 2-mm-diameter sections of antral mucosa resulted in ulcer craters 5-7 days later. Ulcer sites were characterized by loss of the mucosa, muscularis mucosa, and much of the submucosa. The exposed submucosa was coated with fibrin and necrotic debris infiltrated with heterophils, the rabbit equivalent of neutrophils. These ulcers strongly resemble human chronic gastric ulcers. Binding of Carafate (sucralfate; Marion Laboratories, Inc., Kansas City, MO) and Maalox (magnesia-alumina oral suspension; Wm. H. Rorer, Inc., Ft. Washington, PA) to ulcer and nearby nonulcer sites in the antrum was assessed 1 hour after drug dosing. Drug binding was determined by aluminum quantitation of stomach wall punch biopsies at necropsy. Both drugs significantly increased aluminum bound to the stomach wall compared with vehicle treatment. Significantly more antiulcer drug was bound to ulcer sites than to nearby nonulcer sites only after sucralfate administration. This model of persistent gastric ulcer should be useful to further study gastric ulcer pathogenesis and treatment. 
7 Category: nervous system diseases. Medical Notes: Liver failure occurring as a component of exertional heatstroke. An unusual case of an exertional heatstroke in a healthy 25-year-old man is presented. Initially, the patient was deeply comatose and developed severe rhabdomyolysis and massive hepatic necrosis. Subsequently, he received a liver transplant with remarkable improvement in his mental status, although the rhabdomyolysis continued. The patient died 41 days after the transplant due to a complicating infection. Providing that infections can be effectively controlled, liver transplants might be a promising therapeutic alternative for the few patients who survive the initial neurological consequences of this unusual event. 
8 Category: nervous system diseases. Medical Notes: Diabetic amyotrophy without pain. A puzzling clinical picture. A patient with weight loss and weakness presents a diagnostic challenge. Drs Moeser and Kent describe an unusual case of diabetic amyotrophy that required extensive workup to arrive at the diagnosis and rule out more serious disease. Symptoms were dramatic, and recovery was spontaneous following conservative treatment. 
9 Category: cardiovascular diseases. Medical Notes: Fluosol: an oxygen-delivery fluid for use in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Fluosol (20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion) is an oxygen-carrying emulsion used to deliver oxygen to ischemic myocardium during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Fluosol is composed of two perfluorochemicals, perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine. It has a high capacity for oxygen solubility, a low viscosity, and a small particle size. Following administration, the perfluorochemicals in fluosol are not metabolized. Rather, most are expired as gaseous particles through the lungs; the remainder are taken up by the organs of the reticuloendothelial system and later expired. When administered during balloon inflation in PTCA, fluosol preserves ventricular wall motion and global left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, it minimizes ST segment changes and preserves cardiac output. Fluosol may be especially useful in patients who have poor contractile reserve, multivessel disease, or serious underlying illness. Other uses under investigation include limitation of myocardial infarct size and chemosensitization or radiosensitization of malignant tumors. Adverse effects secondary to the use of fluosol include ventricular arrhythmias, pruritus, bradycardia, chest pain, dyspnea, and increased respiratory rate. Fluosol must be thawed, admixed, warmed to body temperature, and oxygenated prior to intracoronary administration. The usual administration rate is 60 mL/min during each balloon inflation. 
10 Category: cardiovascular diseases. Medical Notes: Failure of transluminal angioplasty in the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery: case report. Recurrent stenosis of the carotid arteries after a carotid endarterectomy for atherosclerosis can occur as a result of myointimal hyperplasia. This condition was treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Excellent dilatation of the vessel lumen was documented after balloon dilatation. A 6-month follow-up angiographic study, however, demonstrated recurrent high-grade stenosis at the same level in both carotid arteries. Presumably, the failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery results in the same condition after the original endarterectomy, that is, additional myointimal hyperplasia. 

Classify the following notes:
1.Parathyroidectomy in chronic renal failure: a nine-year follow-up study. Seventy-three patients with chronic renal failure who underwent parathyroidectomy between March 1978 and April 1987 were reviewed. Thirty-four patients had undergone sub-total parathyroidectomy, and 39 patients had undergone total parathyroidectomy with parathyroid autograft into the forearm. Eight patients showed persistent hyperparathyroidism requiring a second surgical procedure. In all other patients there was highly statistical improvement in parathyroid hormone, total calcium, ionized calcium, alkaline phosphatase and a significant reduction in calcium x phosphate product. Histological evidence of osteitis fibrosa was present in 21 of 22 patients before surgery. Postoperatively, four showed complete resolution and improvement. Three patients developed histological evidence of osteomalacia during the study period. Only four of the 39 patients who underwent total parathyroidectomy with autograft had true recurrent hyperparathyroidism and only two of the 34 patients who underwent sub-total parathyroidectomy had recurrent disease, indicating that there is little to choose between the two techniques in the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism and its subsequent recurrence. In one patient with recurrence of hyperparathyroidism from a forearm parathyroid graft the histological picture was different from that of normal hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. Although it is probable that abnormal parathyroid tissue had been implanted there was no evidence of invasive growth into the forearm muscle. The most striking feature of long term follow-up was the difference in calcium x phosphate product in patients in whom vascular calcification increased compared to those patients with no change or regression of calcification. Mean calcium phosphate product in those patients with progressive vascular calcification was 4.93 for small and medium size vessels and 5.38 for large vessels compared to 4.10 for small and medium vessels and 4.09 for large vessels. In the former case the serum phosphate was 2.00 and 2.17 as compared to 1.75 or 1.73, suggesting that the aim in patients with end stage renal failure maintained by dialysis should be to control the serum phosphate concentration to 1.8 mmol or less and the calcium x phosphate product to less than 4.2. 
2.Effect of aortic sclerosis on bone mineral measurements by dual-photon absorptiometry. Measurements of the bone mineral content (BMC) of lumbar spine by dual-photon absorptiometry (DPA) are performed mainly in the anteroposterior (AP) projection. Due to superimposition of the abdominal aorta, the BMC measured for patients with aortic calcification usually is too high. To determine the influence of aortic calcifications, DPA scans were performed in the AP-projection on 100 dissected abdominal aortae with different degrees of atherosclerosis placed on a human lumbar spine cast in lucite. The measured values were compared with those obtained in the same projection without the aortae. The average increase of the BMC values relative to the mean for the vertebrae L2 to L4 for aortae with severe complicated lesions, i.e., those containing larger amounts of calcium, was 0.03 g/cm2, with a maximum deviation of 0.09 g/cm2. Aortae with fatty streaks or fibrous plaques did not cause significant increases of the BMC. The mean deviation for aortae with mild complicated lesions, i.e., those containing smaller amounts of calcium, was within the range of instrument precision. 
3.Angiocentric lymphoma with histologic features of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with predominant respiratory and hematologic manifestations. Report of a case and review of the literature Neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) is a rare fatal disease characterized by widespread intravascular proliferations of neoplastic mononuclear cells. Clinically, dermatologic and bizarre neurologic manifestations usually predominate. The origin of the neoplastic cells remains still undetermined. The authors report a patient with NAE peculiar with respect to the following points: (1) the patient predominantly manifested respiratory symptoms and hematologic findings and lacked cutaneous or neurologic manifestations; and (2) immunohistochemical and molecular genetic studies showed the B-cell nature of the neoplastic cells, although previous cases with predominant respiratory or hematologic manifestations were reported to be of endothelial origin. Despite the rarity, this type of NAE or angiocentric lymphoma should be recognized because it is easily confused with other disorders, particularly vasculitis or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
4.Limitations of electroencephalographic monitoring in the detection of cerebral ischemia accompanying carotid endarterectomy. An analysis was undertaken of 458 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed over 6 years with the patient under general anesthesia and with electroencephalographic monitoring. Seventy patients (15%) had electroencephalographic changes suggestive of ischemia with carotid clamping and had shunts placed. Ischemic encephalographic changes occurred in 26% of patients with an occluded contralateral carotid artery, 21% of patients with a prior stroke history, and 12% of patients with no stroke history and a patent contralateral carotid artery. Nineteen strokes (4.1%), nine transient deficits (2.0%), and one death (0.2%) occurred in the 458 endarterectomies in this experience. Ten of the 19 strokes and five of nine transient deficits were immediately apparent when patients awoke from anesthesia. Five of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all five patients with immediate transient deficits had no ischemic electroencephalographic changes during the procedure. Two other patients with immediate strokes initially had ischemic electroencephalographic changes after carotid clamping that reversed with increased blood pressure or shunting. Therefore 7 of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all 5 patients with immediate transient deficits had electroencephalographs unchanged from baseline at completion of the procedure, and thus deficits not manifest by operative electroencephalographic changes developed. Our data do not support the tenet that electroencephalographic monitoring will always predict neurologic deficits accompanying carotid endarterectomy. 
5.The internist in the management of head and neck cancer. The general internist has an important role in the management of head and neck squamous cell cancers. This heterogeneous group of cancers must be accurately diagnosed and staged before planning treatment. Curability is directly related to stage at presentation and, because most patients with such cancers present to internists first, these physicians must be familiar with presenting symptoms and must be suspicious enough to refer patients with symptoms for appropriate evaluation. The work-up of patients with suspected unknown primary cancer presenting as adenopathy is detailed, and the physician is cautioned not to immediately proceed to open biopsy. As many as 10% of such primary cancers remain undetected, although, with proper therapy, the 5-year survival rate for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck is 60%. Those patients cured of head and neck cancer still face significant psychosocial and medical problems, including hypothyroidism, xerostomia, and a 20% rate of second primary cancer. Head and neck cancer is highly preventable; 75% of cases are related to tobacco and alcohol use. Smokeless tobacco has gained popularity among young Americans and is associated with an increased incidence of head and neck cancer at several sites. Education is crucial, and internists must seek strategies to stop patients from using tobacco products. Other etiologic factors include industrial carcinogens, Epstein-Barr virus, and diet. Retrospective serologic and dietary recall studies of vitamin A suggest an etiologic role of diet; vitamin A analogs have been tested in preneoplastic lesions. To reduce mortality from head and neck cancers, the general internist must play a central role in prevention and early detection. 
6.Redevelopment of hepatitis B surface antigen after renal transplantation. A patient with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic renal failure received a renal transplantation. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) disappeared, and antibodies to HBsAg appeared 10 months before transplantation. Liver tests showed no abnormality at transplantation. Six months later, chronic hepatitis reactivated, antibodies to HBsAg disappeared, and HBsAg reappeared. Hepatitis B virus DNA was demonstrated with polymerase chain reaction in the serum collected before transplantation. This observation suggests that low level HBV replication was present before transplantation despite the absence of detectable HBsAg and was reactivated under immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation. 
7.The pathology of heart allograft rejection. The pathologist plays an important role in the care of cardiac transplant recipients. Day-to-day management of immunosuppression is largely dependent on the diagnosis and grading of acute rejection. While noninvasive methods have been tried experimentally, the endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard in monitoring the rejection status of the heart allograft. The diagnosis of rejection, however, is complicated by a variety of other histologic findings, which may be procedural or processing related, due to sampling, or specifically related to transplantation. Failed allografts, whether from autopsy or explantation, provide the opportunity to study short- and long-term changes in the transplanted heart. Allograft arteriopathy, or graft atherosclerosis, is the major limiting factor in long-term recipient survival. While the morphological features of graft arteriopathy have been well described, the mechanism and factors contributing to its development remain unclear. 
8.Heterotopic tissue in lymph nodes. An unrecognized problem. Heterotopic tissue in lymph nodes is both unknown to clinicians and a potential source of confusion with metastatic disease. We reviewed the English literature and found 289 cases of heterotopic tissue in lymph nodes. The majority (84%) of these patients were operated on for malignant neoplasms. The most frequent sites of occurrence was the pelvis (67%), followed by the axilla (14%), neck (14%), groin (3%), abdomen (2%), and mediastinum (less than 1%). The tissue seen is site-specific and frequently resembles a neighboring organ. Three cases have been reported in which heterotopic tissue was mistaken for metastatic disease. These cases illustrate the importance of being familiar with heterotopic tissue in lymph nodes and identifying it when it does occur, to avoid inappropriate therapy. 
9.The Hastings bipolar hemiarthroplasty for subcapital fractures of the femoral neck. A 10-year prospective study. In a 10-year prospective study, 561 displaced subcapital fractures of the femoral neck in 546 patients were treated with the Hastings bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Within six months of their operations, 148 patients had died. In 322 hips followed up, 243 with adequate serial radiographs separated by more than one year, only 14 (5.6%) showed acetabular erosion. A group of 91 had been reviewed for between three and nine years (mean, 4 years 10 months) and of these, 95% had no pain or slight pain only. Comparison with an earlier series of conventional hemiarthroplasties reported from this institution showed that the clinical results were similar, but that the erosion rate had been halved. 
10.Achalasia in the elderly. Effects of aging on clinical presentation and outcome. Clinical and manometric data from 13 elderly subjects with idiopathic achalasia (mean age 79 +/- 2 years) were compared with findings from younger subjects with the same disease (n = 79) to see if aging altered the presentation and outcome of this motor disorder. Fewer elderly subjects complained of chest pain (27% vs 53%), and the pain was significantly less severe (P less than 0.01). Other presenting features (including sex, duration of symptoms, and presence and severity of dysphagia) did not differ between the groups. Across all patients, age weakly and inversely correlated with residual postdeglutitive lower esophageal sphincter; (LES) pressure (R = -0.34), and residual pressure was significantly lower in the older subjects (8.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg vs. 11.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; P = 0.02). No differences in basal LES pressure or esophageal-body contraction amplitudes were present between the groups. Initial success with pneumatic dilation was similar in the two subject groups, but the number of older subjects available for analysis was too small to draw strong conclusions. These results indicate that aging decreases the elevation of LES residual pressure that occurs with achalasia. As elderly achalasia patients also present with less chest pain, the findings may be interrelated.
