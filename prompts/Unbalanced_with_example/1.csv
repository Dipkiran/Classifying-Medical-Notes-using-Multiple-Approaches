Give downloadable output in CSV format, where the first column would be the note that I give as an input, and the second column will be one of the five categories associated with notes. Please do not write any explanations. 
 
Use the examples to learn more about the five categories: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, 
and general pathological conditions. Here are the two examples of each categories:

1 Category: general pathological conditions. Medical Notes: Pulmonary arterial and venous constriction during hypoxia in 3- to 5-wk-old and adult ferrets. We have determined the sites of hypoxic vasoconstriction in ferret lungs. Lungs of five 3- to 5-wk-old and five adult ferrets were isolated and perfused with blood. Blood flow was adjusted initially to keep pulmonary arterial pressure at 20 cmH2O and left atrial and airway pressures at 6 and 8 cmH2O, respectively (zone 3). Once adjusted, flow was kept constant throughout the experiment. In each lung, pressures were measured in subpleural 20- to 50-microns-diam arterioles and venules with the micropipette servo-nulling method during normoxia (PO2 approximately 100 Torr) and hypoxia (PO2 less than 50 Torr). In normoxic adult ferret lungs, approximately 40% of total vascular resistance was in arteries, approximately 40% was in microvessels, and approximately 20% was in veins. With hypoxia, the total arteriovenous pressure drop increased by 68%. Arterial and venous pressure drops increased by 92 and 132%, respectively, with no change in microvascular pressure drop. In 3- to 5-wk-old ferret lungs, the vascular pressure profile during normoxia and the response to hypoxia were similar to those in adult lungs. We conclude that, in ferret lungs, arterial and venous resistances increase equally during hypoxia, resulting in increased microvascular pressures for fluid filtration. 
2 Category: general pathological conditions. Medical Notes: Pars plana vitrectomy for acute retinal detachment in penetrating ocular injuries. We studied 41 eyes with acute retinal detachment after penetrating ocular trauma in a retrospective cohort analysis. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed in 28 eyes, while the remaining 13 eyes had only primary repair and closure of the wound. The two groups differed in the type of trauma (more gunshot wounds in the vitrectomy group and more blunt injuries in the nonvitrectomized group). Visual success (visual acuity of 5/200 or better) was observed in 10 (37%) of the eyes treated by vitrectomy compared with one (8%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group. Anatomic success was achieved in 21 (75%) of the eyes in the vitrectomy group but in only one (8%) of those in the nonvitrectomy group. Enucleation or phthisis was observed in seven (54%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group compared with only five (18%) in the vitrectomy group. Significant prognostic factors for anatomic outcome in the vitrectomy group were the location of the laceration and the presence of the lens. 
3 Category: neoplasms. Medical Notes: Resection and reconstruction for bone tumors in the proximal tibia. The proximal tibia is a common site for both benign and malignant tumors. This article reviews pertinent anatomy, clinical presentation, and staging methods for tumors of this area. Discussion is given to various methods of resection and reconstruction with useful guidelines for procedure selection. The use of allografts for reconstruction is discussed in depth. 
4 Category: neoplasms. Medical Notes: Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration of retroperitoneal lymph nodes in gynecologic oncology. Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed on 30 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 29 patients with gynecologic cancer. There were no serious complications. Review of the cytologic material demonstrated malignant cells in 83% of the aspirates. Because the predictive value of a positive aspirate approaches 100%, therapy for metastatic disease can be initiated in these patients with the need for an open biopsy. Among five aspirates in which malignant cells were not seen, the cellularity of the specimen appeared to be the critical factor determining the predictive value of the aspirate. Whereas neither of two patients with negative aspirates of adequate cellularity has developed recurrent disease, two of three patients with hypocellular negative aspirates have. Because a hypocellular negative aspirate from a retroperitoneal lymph node may not be a true reflection of disease status, either repeat aspiration or open biopsy is advisable. 
5 Category: digestive system diseases. Medical Notes: Simultaneous bilateral hernia repair. A case against conventional wisdom. The timing of bilateral hernia repair remains controversial. Because of reported high recurrence rates after simultaneous bilateral repair, staged procedures have been suggested. This study determined recurrence and complication rates of unilateral versus simultaneous bilateral repair. Of 659 patients undergoing hernia repair between 1974 and 1980, 333 underwent unilateral repair and 329 had simultaneous bilateral repair. More than 90% of patients were followed until death or a minimum of 60 months (median, 104 months). Perioperative complications were associated with 18% of repairs. More morbidity occurred in the bilateral group. However complication rates for specific events were not significantly different, except for urinary retention, which occurred in 20 patients (6.1%) of the unilateral group and 49 (15%) of the bilateral group (p less than 0.001). Overall 25 recurrences occurred in the unilateral group and 31 in the bilateral group. Recurrence rates at 5 and 9 years were, respectively, 4.8% and 8.8% in the unilateral group and 5.0% and 9.1% in the bilateral group (p = 0.861). These data suggest that simultaneous bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy does not result in increased rates of most postoperative complications or recurrence when compared with unilateral repair. 
6 Category: digestive system diseases. Medical Notes: Mucosal injury and gamma-irradiation produce persistent gastric ulcers in the rabbit. Evaluation of antiulcer drug binding to experimental ulcer sites. A method producing persistent gastric ulcers in the rhesus monkey by combined mucosal injury and gamma-irradiation was modified and evaluated in the rabbit. gamma-Irradiation (800-1000 cGy) immediately after removal of 2-mm-diameter sections of antral mucosa resulted in ulcer craters 5-7 days later. Ulcer sites were characterized by loss of the mucosa, muscularis mucosa, and much of the submucosa. The exposed submucosa was coated with fibrin and necrotic debris infiltrated with heterophils, the rabbit equivalent of neutrophils. These ulcers strongly resemble human chronic gastric ulcers. Binding of Carafate (sucralfate; Marion Laboratories, Inc., Kansas City, MO) and Maalox (magnesia-alumina oral suspension; Wm. H. Rorer, Inc., Ft. Washington, PA) to ulcer and nearby nonulcer sites in the antrum was assessed 1 hour after drug dosing. Drug binding was determined by aluminum quantitation of stomach wall punch biopsies at necropsy. Both drugs significantly increased aluminum bound to the stomach wall compared with vehicle treatment. Significantly more antiulcer drug was bound to ulcer sites than to nearby nonulcer sites only after sucralfate administration. This model of persistent gastric ulcer should be useful to further study gastric ulcer pathogenesis and treatment. 
7 Category: nervous system diseases. Medical Notes: Liver failure occurring as a component of exertional heatstroke. An unusual case of an exertional heatstroke in a healthy 25-year-old man is presented. Initially, the patient was deeply comatose and developed severe rhabdomyolysis and massive hepatic necrosis. Subsequently, he received a liver transplant with remarkable improvement in his mental status, although the rhabdomyolysis continued. The patient died 41 days after the transplant due to a complicating infection. Providing that infections can be effectively controlled, liver transplants might be a promising therapeutic alternative for the few patients who survive the initial neurological consequences of this unusual event. 
8 Category: nervous system diseases. Medical Notes: Diabetic amyotrophy without pain. A puzzling clinical picture. A patient with weight loss and weakness presents a diagnostic challenge. Drs Moeser and Kent describe an unusual case of diabetic amyotrophy that required extensive workup to arrive at the diagnosis and rule out more serious disease. Symptoms were dramatic, and recovery was spontaneous following conservative treatment. 
9 Category: cardiovascular diseases. Medical Notes: Fluosol: an oxygen-delivery fluid for use in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Fluosol (20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion) is an oxygen-carrying emulsion used to deliver oxygen to ischemic myocardium during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Fluosol is composed of two perfluorochemicals, perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine. It has a high capacity for oxygen solubility, a low viscosity, and a small particle size. Following administration, the perfluorochemicals in fluosol are not metabolized. Rather, most are expired as gaseous particles through the lungs; the remainder are taken up by the organs of the reticuloendothelial system and later expired. When administered during balloon inflation in PTCA, fluosol preserves ventricular wall motion and global left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, it minimizes ST segment changes and preserves cardiac output. Fluosol may be especially useful in patients who have poor contractile reserve, multivessel disease, or serious underlying illness. Other uses under investigation include limitation of myocardial infarct size and chemosensitization or radiosensitization of malignant tumors. Adverse effects secondary to the use of fluosol include ventricular arrhythmias, pruritus, bradycardia, chest pain, dyspnea, and increased respiratory rate. Fluosol must be thawed, admixed, warmed to body temperature, and oxygenated prior to intracoronary administration. The usual administration rate is 60 mL/min during each balloon inflation. 
10 Category: cardiovascular diseases. Medical Notes: Failure of transluminal angioplasty in the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery: case report. Recurrent stenosis of the carotid arteries after a carotid endarterectomy for atherosclerosis can occur as a result of myointimal hyperplasia. This condition was treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Excellent dilatation of the vessel lumen was documented after balloon dilatation. A 6-month follow-up angiographic study, however, demonstrated recurrent high-grade stenosis at the same level in both carotid arteries. Presumably, the failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery results in the same condition after the original endarterectomy, that is, additional myointimal hyperplasia. 

Classify the following notes:
1.Relation of cardiac output at rest and during exercise to age in essential hypertension. It has been suggested that the decline of cardiac output with age is due to increased prevalence of disease, particularly occult coronary artery disease. Therefore, the relation of cardiac output (direct oxygen Fick method) to age was analyzed in 110 sixteen- to 64-year-old men with World Health Organization stage I or II essential hypertension at the time of the hemodynamic study, who were alive and free of cardiovascular complications 7 years later. At supine and seated rest, during upright bicycle exercise at 50 W and and at peak work load, cardiac output was inversely (p less than 0.01) related to age. These relations were independent of weight and mean intraarterial pressure. Stroke volume decreased with advancing age at supine rest, but not at rest and during exercise in the seated position. Heart rate was not affected by age in the supine position, but was slower in older patients during upright rest and at peak exercise. In conclusion, in patients with essential hypertension who remained free of cardiovascular complications for 7 years, cardiac output was independently and inversely related to age at various levels of activity. These findings suggest that occult cardiovascular disease does not explain the decline in cardiac output with age in patients with essential hypertension. 
2.Embolism of cerebral tissue: a cause of coagulopathy and cerebral infarction? Report of a case. We report a case of potentially survivable closed head injury, which was complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation and bilateral cerebral infarction. Autopsy disclosed pulmonary emboli composed of cerebral tissue. We suggest that the entry of brain tissue into the systemic blood circulation caused severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, with consequent thrombosis of cerebral veins and spreading infarction. 
3.Preoperative cell-mediated immune function and the prognosis of patients with gastric carcinoma. The cell-mediated immune function of 83 patients with gastric carcinoma was assessed preoperatively and the results were compared to that of 52 patients with benign lesions. The data were subjected to an analysis in order to evaluate their prognostic significance. The abilities to induce allogeneic cytotoxicity and to produce interleukin 2 (IL2) in patients with stage IV carcinoma were significantly depressed, as compared to those in patients with benign lesions, whereas natural killer (NK) cell activity was not significantly impaired. There was no significant correlation among these immune functions. When the patients were stratified into two groups, those who had high (greater than the mean value in patients with benign lesions) and low (less than the same value) values of these immune reactivities, the survival of patients with high NK activity (greater than or equal to 43%) was significantly better, as compared to that of patients with low cytotoxicity (less than 43%). However, there was no correlation between the survival and allogeneic cytotoxicity in these patients. The high ability to produce IL2 (greater than or equal to 1.3 U/ml) correlated with the better survival in the patients, but not in the group of patients who underwent curative resection. 
4.An immunofluorescence study of cerebral malaria. A correlation with histopathology. Histopathologic and immunopathologic features of cerebral malaria have been defined in a study of six autopsy cases with severe Plasmodium falciparum infection. In five cases, immunofluorescent studies demonstrated intense deposition of P falciparum antigen, IgG, and fibrin in cerebral vessels associated with the histopathologic finding of hemorrhage in the white matter of cerebrum and cerebellum regardless of the presence of parasitized erythrocytes in the cerebral vessels. Immunofluorescent study also demonstrated the extravascular deposits of P falciparum granular antigen associated with acute inflammatory lesion in cerebral tissue in one case. These findings suggested that the immunopathogenic mechanism may in some way play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. 
5.Identification, prevention, and treatment of silicone oil pupillary block after an inferior iridectomy. We treated two patients in whom silicone oil pupillary block developed despite a patent inferior iridectomy. The clinical characteristics of this complication were a deep anterior chamber, specular reflexes from the iris surface, identification by biomicroscopy of aqueous trapped inferiorly in the vitreous cavity, and no convection currents in the anterior chamber. This complication may be prevented by early face-down positioning of the patient after the operation, and the avoidance of large, centrally located, inferior iridectomies. We recommend that the iridectomy be placed peripherally no larger than 2 mm and propose a new technique for breaking the silicone oil block, which was clearly successful in one of the patients. 
6.Treatment of intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy with thrombin. Report of three patients. Of 165 consecutive patients undergoing computerized tomography- or magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic brain biopsies at the Cleveland Clinic between June, 1987, and November, 1989, four patients (2.4%) developed arterial hemorrhage refractory to conventional efforts to secure hemostasis. Craniotomy was performed in one of these patients to control the hemorrhage; in the other three, 0.5 to 2 cc of thrombin (5000 U/cc) was slowly injected via the biopsy cannula, resulting in immediate control of bleeding in all three cases. Postoperatively, the first two patients treated with 1 to 2 cc of thrombin were slow to awaken; one had evidence of vasospasm by transcranial Doppler ultrasound studies and multiple infarcts on cranial computerized tomography, while the other had a moderate-sized frontal hematoma with intracranial hypertension. After prolonged recovery periods, only mild neurological deficits persisted in both patients. The third patient, treated with 0.5 cc of thrombin, had an uneventful postoperative course. Thrombin is highly effective for stopping intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy; however, it is a vasospastic agent and may have been responsible for the cerebral infarctions in one patient. Therefore, thrombin should be used only as a last resort, short of craniotomy, to control intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy. 
7.The contribution of routine follow-up mammography to an early detection of asynchronous contralateral breast cancer. The role of routine mammography was assessed in the early detection of asynchronous contralateral breast cancer (ACBC). The breast cancer patient populations of two cities, Nijmegen and Eindhoven, The Netherlands, which were subjected to a well-defined follow-up program, were compared. The program consisted of regular physical examination and annual mammography in Nijmegen and physical examination only in Eindhoven. From 1975 until 1987, 24 ACBC patients were detected within a group of 880 breast cancer patients in Nijmegen (3%) and, from 1971 until 1984, 14 ACBC patients within a group of 411 patients in Eindhoven (3%). In Nijmegen, eight of the 23 evaluable patients (35%) had a contralateral tumor with a histologic size smaller than 10 mm or an in situ carcinoma, compared with one of the 14 of the Eindhoven patients (7%), whereas 18 of the 24 (75%) versus eight of the 14 patients (57%) were node-negative. Thus annual mammography is very likely a contribution in the early detection of contralateral breast cancer as compared with follow-up by regular physical examination only. 
8.Effect of indecainide in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Indecainide, a new antiarrhythmic agent classified as type Ic was evaluated in 11 patients with heart disease who had greater than or equal to 30 ventricular premature complexes/hour, moderate-to-marked left ventricular dysfunction, and mean ejection fraction 34% +/- 8%. Patients received indecainide, 50 mg by mouth, every 6 hours and the dose was increased until greater than or equal to 80% suppression was noted, adverse effects occurred, or a maximum dose of 100 mg indecainide was given every 6 hours. Ventricular premature complexes were suppressed greater than or equal to 80% in nine patients (p less than 0.05) and ventricular tachycardia episodes were completely suppressed in five of eight patients. The effective or maximal mean daily indecainide dose was 191 +/- 32 mg; half of the responders achieved achieved efficacy at serum drug concentration greater than or equal to 600 ng/ml. Serum drug concentration was directly related to gender (r = 0.78, p less than 0.04) and inversely related to creatinine clearance (r = 0.74, p less than 0.05) and ejection fraction (r = 0.71, p less than 0.02). Indecainide prolonged mean PR and QRS intervals (p less than 0.05) but not QT or QTc. There was a linear relation between percent change in PR (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) and QRS (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001) intervals and serum drug concentration. After starting or increasing the dose, careful observation of patients with decreased renal function or reduced ejection fraction should be exercised because they attain higher drug concentration than normal subjects. 
9.The addition of doxazosin to the treatment regimen of patients with hypertension not adequately controlled by beta-blockers. When doxazosin was given to patients with hypertension not adequately controlled by beta-blockade, blood pressure was normalized in 94% of the 34 patients (blood pressure less than or equal to 140/85 mm Hg). This reduction in blood pressure was obtained with doxazosin in combination with metoprolol or oxprenolol at a mean final daily dose of 1.3 mg or pindolol or atenolol at 2.0 mg/day. Exercise-induced increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was also lower with combined beta-blocker and doxazosin therapy than with beta-blocker alone. After 12 weeks of treatment, the combination of doxazosin and beta-blocker significantly reduced total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. All side effects were mild and only one patient was withdrawn from therapy. 
10.Vigabatrin: rational treatment for chronic epilepsy. Vigabatrin is a selective, irreversible suicide inhibitor of GABA transaminase and thus increases brain and CSF GABA. In 33 adult patients with long standing refractory epilepsy on treatment with one or two standard anti-convulsant drugs, the addition of vigabatrin up to 3g daily for eight weeks was associated with a 48.2% reduction in seizure frequency. Twenty patients who had exhibited a 50% or more reduction in frequency of one or more seizure types entered an eight week double-blind placebo controlled phase. Patients on vigabatrin maintained a 54.7% reduction of seizure frequency, whereas those on placebo showed an 18.6% increase in seizure frequency, a highly significant difference between the two groups. In the open phase, seven patients were withdrawn due to unacceptable and reversible adverse events. The commonest side effects were drowsiness, depression and mood instability, and headaches. Vigabatrin is a potentially valuable new treatment for chronic epilepsy, especially partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation.
