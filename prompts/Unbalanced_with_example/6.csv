Use the examples to learn more about the five categories: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, 
and general pathological conditions. Here are the two examples of each categories:

1 Category: general pathological conditions. Medical Notes: Pulmonary arterial and venous constriction during hypoxia in 3- to 5-wk-old and adult ferrets. We have determined the sites of hypoxic vasoconstriction in ferret lungs. Lungs of five 3- to 5-wk-old and five adult ferrets were isolated and perfused with blood. Blood flow was adjusted initially to keep pulmonary arterial pressure at 20 cmH2O and left atrial and airway pressures at 6 and 8 cmH2O, respectively (zone 3). Once adjusted, flow was kept constant throughout the experiment. In each lung, pressures were measured in subpleural 20- to 50-microns-diam arterioles and venules with the micropipette servo-nulling method during normoxia (PO2 approximately 100 Torr) and hypoxia (PO2 less than 50 Torr). In normoxic adult ferret lungs, approximately 40% of total vascular resistance was in arteries, approximately 40% was in microvessels, and approximately 20% was in veins. With hypoxia, the total arteriovenous pressure drop increased by 68%. Arterial and venous pressure drops increased by 92 and 132%, respectively, with no change in microvascular pressure drop. In 3- to 5-wk-old ferret lungs, the vascular pressure profile during normoxia and the response to hypoxia were similar to those in adult lungs. We conclude that, in ferret lungs, arterial and venous resistances increase equally during hypoxia, resulting in increased microvascular pressures for fluid filtration. 
2 Category: general pathological conditions. Medical Notes: Pars plana vitrectomy for acute retinal detachment in penetrating ocular injuries. We studied 41 eyes with acute retinal detachment after penetrating ocular trauma in a retrospective cohort analysis. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed in 28 eyes, while the remaining 13 eyes had only primary repair and closure of the wound. The two groups differed in the type of trauma (more gunshot wounds in the vitrectomy group and more blunt injuries in the nonvitrectomized group). Visual success (visual acuity of 5/200 or better) was observed in 10 (37%) of the eyes treated by vitrectomy compared with one (8%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group. Anatomic success was achieved in 21 (75%) of the eyes in the vitrectomy group but in only one (8%) of those in the nonvitrectomy group. Enucleation or phthisis was observed in seven (54%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group compared with only five (18%) in the vitrectomy group. Significant prognostic factors for anatomic outcome in the vitrectomy group were the location of the laceration and the presence of the lens. 
3 Category: neoplasms. Medical Notes: Resection and reconstruction for bone tumors in the proximal tibia. The proximal tibia is a common site for both benign and malignant tumors. This article reviews pertinent anatomy, clinical presentation, and staging methods for tumors of this area. Discussion is given to various methods of resection and reconstruction with useful guidelines for procedure selection. The use of allografts for reconstruction is discussed in depth. 
4 Category: neoplasms. Medical Notes: Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration of retroperitoneal lymph nodes in gynecologic oncology. Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed on 30 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 29 patients with gynecologic cancer. There were no serious complications. Review of the cytologic material demonstrated malignant cells in 83% of the aspirates. Because the predictive value of a positive aspirate approaches 100%, therapy for metastatic disease can be initiated in these patients with the need for an open biopsy. Among five aspirates in which malignant cells were not seen, the cellularity of the specimen appeared to be the critical factor determining the predictive value of the aspirate. Whereas neither of two patients with negative aspirates of adequate cellularity has developed recurrent disease, two of three patients with hypocellular negative aspirates have. Because a hypocellular negative aspirate from a retroperitoneal lymph node may not be a true reflection of disease status, either repeat aspiration or open biopsy is advisable. 
5 Category: digestive system diseases. Medical Notes: Simultaneous bilateral hernia repair. A case against conventional wisdom. The timing of bilateral hernia repair remains controversial. Because of reported high recurrence rates after simultaneous bilateral repair, staged procedures have been suggested. This study determined recurrence and complication rates of unilateral versus simultaneous bilateral repair. Of 659 patients undergoing hernia repair between 1974 and 1980, 333 underwent unilateral repair and 329 had simultaneous bilateral repair. More than 90% of patients were followed until death or a minimum of 60 months (median, 104 months). Perioperative complications were associated with 18% of repairs. More morbidity occurred in the bilateral group. However complication rates for specific events were not significantly different, except for urinary retention, which occurred in 20 patients (6.1%) of the unilateral group and 49 (15%) of the bilateral group (p less than 0.001). Overall 25 recurrences occurred in the unilateral group and 31 in the bilateral group. Recurrence rates at 5 and 9 years were, respectively, 4.8% and 8.8% in the unilateral group and 5.0% and 9.1% in the bilateral group (p = 0.861). These data suggest that simultaneous bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy does not result in increased rates of most postoperative complications or recurrence when compared with unilateral repair. 
6 Category: digestive system diseases. Medical Notes: Mucosal injury and gamma-irradiation produce persistent gastric ulcers in the rabbit. Evaluation of antiulcer drug binding to experimental ulcer sites. A method producing persistent gastric ulcers in the rhesus monkey by combined mucosal injury and gamma-irradiation was modified and evaluated in the rabbit. gamma-Irradiation (800-1000 cGy) immediately after removal of 2-mm-diameter sections of antral mucosa resulted in ulcer craters 5-7 days later. Ulcer sites were characterized by loss of the mucosa, muscularis mucosa, and much of the submucosa. The exposed submucosa was coated with fibrin and necrotic debris infiltrated with heterophils, the rabbit equivalent of neutrophils. These ulcers strongly resemble human chronic gastric ulcers. Binding of Carafate (sucralfate; Marion Laboratories, Inc., Kansas City, MO) and Maalox (magnesia-alumina oral suspension; Wm. H. Rorer, Inc., Ft. Washington, PA) to ulcer and nearby nonulcer sites in the antrum was assessed 1 hour after drug dosing. Drug binding was determined by aluminum quantitation of stomach wall punch biopsies at necropsy. Both drugs significantly increased aluminum bound to the stomach wall compared with vehicle treatment. Significantly more antiulcer drug was bound to ulcer sites than to nearby nonulcer sites only after sucralfate administration. This model of persistent gastric ulcer should be useful to further study gastric ulcer pathogenesis and treatment. 
7 Category: nervous system diseases. Medical Notes: Liver failure occurring as a component of exertional heatstroke. An unusual case of an exertional heatstroke in a healthy 25-year-old man is presented. Initially, the patient was deeply comatose and developed severe rhabdomyolysis and massive hepatic necrosis. Subsequently, he received a liver transplant with remarkable improvement in his mental status, although the rhabdomyolysis continued. The patient died 41 days after the transplant due to a complicating infection. Providing that infections can be effectively controlled, liver transplants might be a promising therapeutic alternative for the few patients who survive the initial neurological consequences of this unusual event. 
8 Category: nervous system diseases. Medical Notes: Diabetic amyotrophy without pain. A puzzling clinical picture. A patient with weight loss and weakness presents a diagnostic challenge. Drs Moeser and Kent describe an unusual case of diabetic amyotrophy that required extensive workup to arrive at the diagnosis and rule out more serious disease. Symptoms were dramatic, and recovery was spontaneous following conservative treatment. 
9 Category: cardiovascular diseases. Medical Notes: Fluosol: an oxygen-delivery fluid for use in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Fluosol (20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion) is an oxygen-carrying emulsion used to deliver oxygen to ischemic myocardium during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Fluosol is composed of two perfluorochemicals, perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine. It has a high capacity for oxygen solubility, a low viscosity, and a small particle size. Following administration, the perfluorochemicals in fluosol are not metabolized. Rather, most are expired as gaseous particles through the lungs; the remainder are taken up by the organs of the reticuloendothelial system and later expired. When administered during balloon inflation in PTCA, fluosol preserves ventricular wall motion and global left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, it minimizes ST segment changes and preserves cardiac output. Fluosol may be especially useful in patients who have poor contractile reserve, multivessel disease, or serious underlying illness. Other uses under investigation include limitation of myocardial infarct size and chemosensitization or radiosensitization of malignant tumors. Adverse effects secondary to the use of fluosol include ventricular arrhythmias, pruritus, bradycardia, chest pain, dyspnea, and increased respiratory rate. Fluosol must be thawed, admixed, warmed to body temperature, and oxygenated prior to intracoronary administration. The usual administration rate is 60 mL/min during each balloon inflation. 
10 Category: cardiovascular diseases. Medical Notes: Failure of transluminal angioplasty in the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery: case report. Recurrent stenosis of the carotid arteries after a carotid endarterectomy for atherosclerosis can occur as a result of myointimal hyperplasia. This condition was treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Excellent dilatation of the vessel lumen was documented after balloon dilatation. A 6-month follow-up angiographic study, however, demonstrated recurrent high-grade stenosis at the same level in both carotid arteries. Presumably, the failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery results in the same condition after the original endarterectomy, that is, additional myointimal hyperplasia. 

Classify the following notes:
1.Diagnostic significance of carcinoembryonic antigen in the differential diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. The histologic and cytologic distinction of malignant mesothelioma from carcinomas metastatic to the pleura or peritoneum is often problematic. For this reason immunologic methods are being increasingly used as diagnostic adjuncts. This review summarizes 40 studies on the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen in mesotheliomas and in lung and other carcinomas involving the pleura or peritoneum. Carcinoembryonic antigen was identified immunohistochemically in 11% of mesotheliomas and in 84% of carcinomas examined and immunocytochemically (in serous effusions) in 4% and 58%, respectively. In serum and in pleural or ascitic fluid, significantly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen are commonly associated with (lung) carcinomas but rarely with mesotheliomas. Thus, together with identification of the antigen in serum, pleural fluid, or ascitic fluid, immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical techniques for detecting carcinoembryonic antigen provide a valuable aid for distinguishing malignant mesothelioma from metastatic carcinomas. 
2.Pathophysiological aspects of edema formation in diabetic nephropathy. The present study was undertaken to evaluate some pathophysiological mechanisms of edema formation in diabetic nephropathy. Sixty-three subjects were investigated: 9 normal subjects (I), 9 normoalbuminuric Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients (II), 15 microalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic patients (III), 16 Type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy without edema (IV), and 14 Type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy and edema (V). Plasma volume (125I-albumin), glomerular filtration rate and extracellular fluid volume (51Cr-EDTA) were measured. Colloid osmotic pressure and albumin concentration were measured in plasma and in subcutaneous interstitial fluid (suction blister technique). The ratio between plasma volume and interstitial fluid volume was reduced in patients with edema compared with group 1 (P less than 0.05). The interstitial colloid osmotic pressure (mm Hg) was significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) in group V compared with the other groups (V: 4.3 +/- 1.1, I: 7.9 +/- 1.7, II: 7.5 +/- 1.8, III: 6.6 +/- 1.5, IV: 6.6 +/- 1.1), but the transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient in patients with edema was comparable with the remaining subjects. The ratio between interstitial and plasma albumin concentration was significantly reduced in group V compared with groups I and II (V: 0.31 +/- 0.1, I: 0.43 +/- 0.06, II: 0.44 +/- 0.06; P less than 0.01; III: 0.41 +/- 0.07, IV: 0.41 +/- 0.08). This reduction was mainly due to enhanced lymph flow. The wash-down of subcutaneous interstitial protein indicated increased capillary filtration, but at the same time limited the increase in net filtration pressure and thereby prevented progressive edema formation in diabetic nephropathy. 
3.Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in malignant mesothelioma of tunica vaginalis testis. A case of metastatic mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis in a 57-year-old man is reported. Clinicopathological findings and treatment options are reviewed. 
4.Age, sex, and road-use patterns of motor vehicular trauma in Rhode Island: A population-based hospital emergency department study. Population-based hospital emergency department data on motor vehicle traffic trauma in Rhode Island, 1984-85, are analyzed by age, sex, and road-use status. Annualized rates of overall and severe trauma were 1,195 cases (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1,164, 1,225) and 102 cases (95% CI = 94, 111) per 100,000 population, respectively. Overall and severe rates peaked at ages 15-24 years. Male rate excesses were most pronounced for motor-cycle and pedal cycle trauma. 
5.Thirty-year follow-up of superior vena cava-pulmonary artery (Glenn) shunts. The first superior vena cava-pulmonary artery shunt (Glenn shunt) in our series was performed in February 1958. From then through September 1988, 91 patients have undergone this procedure for a wide variety of congenital defects. We here report follow-up data available on all patients. Ages ranged from 2 days to 46 years (mean 6.8). Diagnoses were as follows: tricuspid atresia, 27; single ventricle, 22; tetralogy of Fallot, 14; D-transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis, 9; D-transposition, 5; Ebstein's anomaly, 4; pulmonary atresia + intact septum, 4; and others, 6. The hospital mortality rate was 7.7% (one death in the last 53 patients, 1.9%). Five deaths occurred in patients less than 6 months old. There were 20 late deaths (22%) with actuarial survival rates of 84% and 66% at 10 and 20 years, respectively. Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula formation was seen in 18 patients (19.7%), six of whom have undergone therapeutic embolization with improvement in saturation. The prevalence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula increases with time after shunt. No long-term shunt thrombosis or stricture formation was seen. Fifty percent of shunts were still functioning at 20 years. Palliation was limited because of decrease in blood flow to the contralateral pulmonary artery, collaterals between the inferior and superior venae cavae, and pulmonary arteriovenous fistula formation. Improvement in saturation was obtained in eight otherwise inoperable patients by creation of a right axillary arteriovenous fistula up to 19 years after the Glenn shunt. Three patients had conversion of a Blalock-Taussig shunt to a Glenn shunt with improvement in congestive heart failure. Twenty-six patients have undergone a Fontan procedure with two deaths. Compared with the group having a Fontan procedure without a prior Glenn operation, there was no difference in early or late mortality. Thirty years after a Glenn shunt, the first patient in this series is working full time after having undergone a modified Fontan procedure in 1981. We conclude that the Glenn connection, usually with supplemental procedures to enhance oxygenation, has provided excellent physiologic palliation with low mortality up to 30 years with no late thrombosis or stricture formation. The incidence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula increases with time and can be effectively treated with embolization. Physiologic repair after the Glenn shunt carries a low mortality. Although currently used infrequently, superior vena cava-pulmonary artery shunting remains a useful method of palliation in selected patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
6.The abdominal trauma index--a critical reassessment and validation. The Abdominal Trauma Index (ATI) was devised to quantify the risk of complications following abdominal trauma. With scores greater than 25, the risk of postoperative complications became exponential. The purpose of the present study was to determine if: 1) the organ risk factors previously assigned were more statistically valid; and 2) the addition of physiologic variables would enhance the prediction of postinjury intra-abdominal sepsis. Fifteen abdominal organ systems and 17 physiologic variables in 300 consecutive patients were analyzed to determine ability to predict intraabdominal sepsis. There were no significant differences in predictive ability between the old and new organ risk factors. The addition of physiologic factors did not enhance the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis. This clinical study demonstrates that: 1) the risk of intra-abdominal sepsis increases with increasing ATI score; 2) the previous (1979-initial) organ risk grading concept is statistically valid; 3) six of the 15 organ systems warrant a change in their relative rank order (1989-revision); 4) the addition of demographic, physiologic, and immunologic variables did not significantly improve the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis. 
7.Regulation of insulin, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor-alpha levels by growth factor-degrading enzymes. The mechanisms by which growth factors are degraded and the role this process plays in the regulation of cell growth are not well understood. Insulin degradation is believed to be mediated by a specific metalloprotease, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). We have previously shown that IDE can also degrade transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha), but not epidermal growth factor (EGF), in vitro. This selectivity was surprising, since TGF alpha and EGF are structurally similar and bind to the same receptor with comparable affinities. Using a spectrum of protease inhibitors, we have now analyzed the degradation of TGF alpha, EGF, and insulin by human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The results suggest that bacitracin-sensitive metalloproteases are involved in the degradation of TGF alpha and EGF as well as insulin, and that the degradation of TGF alpha, but not EGF, is mediated in part by IDE. Inhibiting the activity of these metalloproteases decreased growth factor depletion, suggesting that these enzymes play an important role in the control of extracellular growth factor levels. The existence of separate degradative pathways for EGF and TGF alpha may explain how the two factors exert differential effects in some systems, and degradation of TGF alpha by IDE would provide a possible mechanism for interaction between the insulin and TGF alpha/EGF signalling systems. 
8.Bipolar hemiarthroplasty for subcapital fracture of the femoral neck. A prospective randomised trial of cemented Thompson and uncemented Moore stems. We performed a randomised prospective trial to compare the results of 27 cemented and 26 uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasties in active patients with displaced subcapital fractures of the femoral neck. After a mean follow-up of 17 months, significantly more of the uncemented group were experiencing pain in the hip and using more walking aids than the patients in the cemented group. The incidence of postoperative complications, the early mortality rate and the operating time and blood loss were not significantly different. Using otherwise identical prostheses the early results were much better with a cemented Thompson stem than with an uncemented Austin Moore stem. 
9.Mobile knee reconstructions after resection of malignant tumors of the distal femur. Limb-salvage surgery involving mobile knee reconstructions for malignant tumors about the distal femur is a desirable and achievable goal. With limb salvage, the survival rate does not decrease significantly, and the resulting function is superior to when an amputation plus a prosthesis are used. Immediate and delayed morbidity is greater after limb-salvage surgery than after amputation. However, with thorough preoperative planning, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as indicated, and an experienced team of surgeons, limb-salvage surgery can provide a mobile knee with excellent function in the vast majority of cases for patients with malignant tumors of the distal femur. 
10.The relationship of "high risk" mammographic patterns to histological risk factors for development of cancer in the human breast. In the UK Trial for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer in Nottingham, 119 women were identified as having fibrocystic change with epithelial hyperplasia or in situ carcinoma. Their mammograms were classified according to Wolfe's criteria and the corresponding histology for each patient was classified for degrees of epithelial hyperplasia, atypia and in situ neoplasia using Page's criteria. A control population of patients presenting for breast screening was used to represent the general population. No correlation was found between the four mammographic Wolfe patterns, N1, P1, P2 and DY and histological evidence of epithelial hyperplasia, atypia or in situ carcinoma. A further study was carried out to determine histological features of Wolfe pattern, using radiological examination of resected breast tissue. The variation in Wolfe pattern was related to the distribution of fibrous and adipose tissue in the breast interlobular stroma and appeared to have no relationship to epithelial parenchymal content. This information does not support the hypothesis that radiographic densities of P2 and DY patterns correspond to high risk epithelial proliferation.
