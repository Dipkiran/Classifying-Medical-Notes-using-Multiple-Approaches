Give downloadable output in CSV format, where the first column would be the note that I give as an input, and the second column will be one of the five categories associated with notes. Please do not write any explanations. 
 
Use the examples to learn more about the five categories: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, 
and general pathological conditions. Here are the two examples of each categories:

1 Category: general pathological conditions. Medical Notes: Pulmonary arterial and venous constriction during hypoxia in 3- to 5-wk-old and adult ferrets. We have determined the sites of hypoxic vasoconstriction in ferret lungs. Lungs of five 3- to 5-wk-old and five adult ferrets were isolated and perfused with blood. Blood flow was adjusted initially to keep pulmonary arterial pressure at 20 cmH2O and left atrial and airway pressures at 6 and 8 cmH2O, respectively (zone 3). Once adjusted, flow was kept constant throughout the experiment. In each lung, pressures were measured in subpleural 20- to 50-microns-diam arterioles and venules with the micropipette servo-nulling method during normoxia (PO2 approximately 100 Torr) and hypoxia (PO2 less than 50 Torr). In normoxic adult ferret lungs, approximately 40% of total vascular resistance was in arteries, approximately 40% was in microvessels, and approximately 20% was in veins. With hypoxia, the total arteriovenous pressure drop increased by 68%. Arterial and venous pressure drops increased by 92 and 132%, respectively, with no change in microvascular pressure drop. In 3- to 5-wk-old ferret lungs, the vascular pressure profile during normoxia and the response to hypoxia were similar to those in adult lungs. We conclude that, in ferret lungs, arterial and venous resistances increase equally during hypoxia, resulting in increased microvascular pressures for fluid filtration. 
2 Category: general pathological conditions. Medical Notes: Pars plana vitrectomy for acute retinal detachment in penetrating ocular injuries. We studied 41 eyes with acute retinal detachment after penetrating ocular trauma in a retrospective cohort analysis. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed in 28 eyes, while the remaining 13 eyes had only primary repair and closure of the wound. The two groups differed in the type of trauma (more gunshot wounds in the vitrectomy group and more blunt injuries in the nonvitrectomized group). Visual success (visual acuity of 5/200 or better) was observed in 10 (37%) of the eyes treated by vitrectomy compared with one (8%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group. Anatomic success was achieved in 21 (75%) of the eyes in the vitrectomy group but in only one (8%) of those in the nonvitrectomy group. Enucleation or phthisis was observed in seven (54%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group compared with only five (18%) in the vitrectomy group. Significant prognostic factors for anatomic outcome in the vitrectomy group were the location of the laceration and the presence of the lens. 
3 Category: neoplasms. Medical Notes: Resection and reconstruction for bone tumors in the proximal tibia. The proximal tibia is a common site for both benign and malignant tumors. This article reviews pertinent anatomy, clinical presentation, and staging methods for tumors of this area. Discussion is given to various methods of resection and reconstruction with useful guidelines for procedure selection. The use of allografts for reconstruction is discussed in depth. 
4 Category: neoplasms. Medical Notes: Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration of retroperitoneal lymph nodes in gynecologic oncology. Computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed on 30 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 29 patients with gynecologic cancer. There were no serious complications. Review of the cytologic material demonstrated malignant cells in 83% of the aspirates. Because the predictive value of a positive aspirate approaches 100%, therapy for metastatic disease can be initiated in these patients with the need for an open biopsy. Among five aspirates in which malignant cells were not seen, the cellularity of the specimen appeared to be the critical factor determining the predictive value of the aspirate. Whereas neither of two patients with negative aspirates of adequate cellularity has developed recurrent disease, two of three patients with hypocellular negative aspirates have. Because a hypocellular negative aspirate from a retroperitoneal lymph node may not be a true reflection of disease status, either repeat aspiration or open biopsy is advisable. 
5 Category: digestive system diseases. Medical Notes: Simultaneous bilateral hernia repair. A case against conventional wisdom. The timing of bilateral hernia repair remains controversial. Because of reported high recurrence rates after simultaneous bilateral repair, staged procedures have been suggested. This study determined recurrence and complication rates of unilateral versus simultaneous bilateral repair. Of 659 patients undergoing hernia repair between 1974 and 1980, 333 underwent unilateral repair and 329 had simultaneous bilateral repair. More than 90% of patients were followed until death or a minimum of 60 months (median, 104 months). Perioperative complications were associated with 18% of repairs. More morbidity occurred in the bilateral group. However complication rates for specific events were not significantly different, except for urinary retention, which occurred in 20 patients (6.1%) of the unilateral group and 49 (15%) of the bilateral group (p less than 0.001). Overall 25 recurrences occurred in the unilateral group and 31 in the bilateral group. Recurrence rates at 5 and 9 years were, respectively, 4.8% and 8.8% in the unilateral group and 5.0% and 9.1% in the bilateral group (p = 0.861). These data suggest that simultaneous bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy does not result in increased rates of most postoperative complications or recurrence when compared with unilateral repair. 
6 Category: digestive system diseases. Medical Notes: Mucosal injury and gamma-irradiation produce persistent gastric ulcers in the rabbit. Evaluation of antiulcer drug binding to experimental ulcer sites. A method producing persistent gastric ulcers in the rhesus monkey by combined mucosal injury and gamma-irradiation was modified and evaluated in the rabbit. gamma-Irradiation (800-1000 cGy) immediately after removal of 2-mm-diameter sections of antral mucosa resulted in ulcer craters 5-7 days later. Ulcer sites were characterized by loss of the mucosa, muscularis mucosa, and much of the submucosa. The exposed submucosa was coated with fibrin and necrotic debris infiltrated with heterophils, the rabbit equivalent of neutrophils. These ulcers strongly resemble human chronic gastric ulcers. Binding of Carafate (sucralfate; Marion Laboratories, Inc., Kansas City, MO) and Maalox (magnesia-alumina oral suspension; Wm. H. Rorer, Inc., Ft. Washington, PA) to ulcer and nearby nonulcer sites in the antrum was assessed 1 hour after drug dosing. Drug binding was determined by aluminum quantitation of stomach wall punch biopsies at necropsy. Both drugs significantly increased aluminum bound to the stomach wall compared with vehicle treatment. Significantly more antiulcer drug was bound to ulcer sites than to nearby nonulcer sites only after sucralfate administration. This model of persistent gastric ulcer should be useful to further study gastric ulcer pathogenesis and treatment. 
7 Category: nervous system diseases. Medical Notes: Liver failure occurring as a component of exertional heatstroke. An unusual case of an exertional heatstroke in a healthy 25-year-old man is presented. Initially, the patient was deeply comatose and developed severe rhabdomyolysis and massive hepatic necrosis. Subsequently, he received a liver transplant with remarkable improvement in his mental status, although the rhabdomyolysis continued. The patient died 41 days after the transplant due to a complicating infection. Providing that infections can be effectively controlled, liver transplants might be a promising therapeutic alternative for the few patients who survive the initial neurological consequences of this unusual event. 
8 Category: nervous system diseases. Medical Notes: Diabetic amyotrophy without pain. A puzzling clinical picture. A patient with weight loss and weakness presents a diagnostic challenge. Drs Moeser and Kent describe an unusual case of diabetic amyotrophy that required extensive workup to arrive at the diagnosis and rule out more serious disease. Symptoms were dramatic, and recovery was spontaneous following conservative treatment. 
9 Category: cardiovascular diseases. Medical Notes: Fluosol: an oxygen-delivery fluid for use in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Fluosol (20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion) is an oxygen-carrying emulsion used to deliver oxygen to ischemic myocardium during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Fluosol is composed of two perfluorochemicals, perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine. It has a high capacity for oxygen solubility, a low viscosity, and a small particle size. Following administration, the perfluorochemicals in fluosol are not metabolized. Rather, most are expired as gaseous particles through the lungs; the remainder are taken up by the organs of the reticuloendothelial system and later expired. When administered during balloon inflation in PTCA, fluosol preserves ventricular wall motion and global left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, it minimizes ST segment changes and preserves cardiac output. Fluosol may be especially useful in patients who have poor contractile reserve, multivessel disease, or serious underlying illness. Other uses under investigation include limitation of myocardial infarct size and chemosensitization or radiosensitization of malignant tumors. Adverse effects secondary to the use of fluosol include ventricular arrhythmias, pruritus, bradycardia, chest pain, dyspnea, and increased respiratory rate. Fluosol must be thawed, admixed, warmed to body temperature, and oxygenated prior to intracoronary administration. The usual administration rate is 60 mL/min during each balloon inflation. 
10 Category: cardiovascular diseases. Medical Notes: Failure of transluminal angioplasty in the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery: case report. Recurrent stenosis of the carotid arteries after a carotid endarterectomy for atherosclerosis can occur as a result of myointimal hyperplasia. This condition was treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Excellent dilatation of the vessel lumen was documented after balloon dilatation. A 6-month follow-up angiographic study, however, demonstrated recurrent high-grade stenosis at the same level in both carotid arteries. Presumably, the failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery results in the same condition after the original endarterectomy, that is, additional myointimal hyperplasia. 

Classify the following notes:
1.Endoscopic variceal ligation in patients who have failed endoscopic sclerotherapy. Endoscopic variceal ligation has been developed as an alternative to endoscopic sclerotherapy. We report a series of 12 men with a history of bleeding esophageal varices who were treated with endoscopic variceal ligation after they had failed sclerotherapy. Hemostasis was achieved in all 10 patients who were bleeding at the time of initial endoscopy and again in those who subsequently re-bled. Over a follow-up period of up to 22 months, varices have been and remain eradicated in five patients; in four others, a reduction in grade was noted before death (two patients), liver transplant, or loss to follow-up (one patient each); two patients died before they could be re-evaluated, while in the remaining patient, no reduction in variceal grade was noted before loss to follow-up. No complication was recorded after 35 endoscopic treatment sessions involving a total of 245 rubber band ligations. Our results indicate that endoscopic variceal ligation may be used with success in patients who fail sclerotherapy. 
2.X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia: linkage to phosphoglycerate kinase at Xq13. Molecular linkage analysis was performed on a kindred with X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia. Two-point analysis with a DNA probe for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1), which maps to Xq13, suggested linkage to the disorder by a lod score of at least 2.60 at a recombination fraction of zero. The disease in this kindred appears to be clinically and genetically distinct from that in previously reported families with X-linked hereditary ataxia or spastic paraparesis. No mapping data are available for inherited X-linked sideroblastic anemia without neurologic abnormalities. However, structural alterations of band Xq13 may be involved in the development of idiopathic acquired sideroblastic anemia. No alterations in the restriction patterns of two X-linked genes involved in erythrocyte formation-i.e., a DNA-binding protein (GF-1) and 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS)-were detected in DNA from affected males, arguing against a large deletion in either of these candidate genes. 
3.Brain microemboli during cardiac surgery or aortography We have observed many focal dilatations or very small aneurysms in terminal arterioles and capillaries of 4 of 5 patients and 6 dogs who had recently undergone cardiopulmonary bypass. A smaller number of sausagelike dilatations distended medium-sized arterioles. Two other patients had a small number of the same microvascular changes following proximal aortography. Thirty-four patients and 6 dogs not undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass had none. (A 35th patient who had not undergone cardiopulmonary bypass or aortography showed a small number of dilatations; mediastinal air was a suggested source.) Some of the dilatations exhibited various forms of birefringence. Because most of the dilatations appear empty, we speculate that they are the sites of gas bubbles or fat emboli that have been removed by the solvents used in processing. These microvascular events, occurring only in conjunction with major arterial interventions, may be the anatomical correlate of the neurological deficits or moderate to severe intellectual dysfunction seen in at least 24% of patients after cardiac surgical procedures assisted by cardiopulmonary bypass. 
4.Stage IV neuroblastoma in infants. Long-term survival. Before the advent of multiagent chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with Stage IV neuroblastoma of all ages was dismal. More recently, marked improvement in infants with Stage IV neuroblastoma has been reported. Twenty-four infants with Stage IV neuroblastoma have been treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/The Children's Hospital, and the Joint Center For Radiation Therapy, Boston, Massachusetts, between 1970 and 1988. Twenty-three of these patients were treated with multiagent chemotherapy and one with a single drug. In the initial report, ten of 11 patients were alive without evidence of disease after intensive therapy. In this report the authors update their initial series of patients and include 13 additional patients who subsequently presented to our institutions with Stage IV neuroblastoma younger than 1 year of age. The 5-year actuarial event-free survival for the 24 patients is 75%. No patient without bone metastases died from neuroblastoma, and 12 of 16 patients with bone metastases remained disease free. These results confirm that infants with Stage IV neuroblastoma have a very good prognosis when treated with intensive multiagent chemotherapy. 
5.Structure, expression and function of a schwannoma-derived growth factor. During the development of the nervous system, cells require growth factors that regulate their division and survival. To identify new growth factors, serum-free growth-conditioned media from many clonal cell lines were screened for the presence of mitogens for central nervous system glial cells. A cell line secreting a potent glial mitogen was established from a tumour (or 'schwannoma') derived from the sheath of the sciatic nerve. The cells of the tumour, named JS1 cells, were adapted to clonal culture and identified as Schwann cells. Schwann cells secrete an autocrine mitogen and human schwannoma extracts have mitogenic activity on glial cells. Until now, neither mitogen has been purified. Here we report the purification and characterization of a mitogenic molecule, designated schwannoma-derived growth factor (SDGF), from the growth-conditioned medium of the JS1 Schwann cell line. SDGF belongs to the epidermal growth factor family, and is an autocrine growth factor as well as a mitogen for astrocytes, Schwann cells and fibroblasts. 
6.Postoperative myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. S.P.I. Research Group. Cardiac morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery continue to be significant problems. To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and prognostic importance of postoperative myocardial ischemia after CABG surgery, the authors monitored 50 patients continuously for 10 perioperative days with the use of two-lead electrocardiography (ECG). ECG changes consistent with ischemia were defined as a reversible ST depression of 1 mm or greater or an elevation of 2 mm or greater from baseline, lasting at least 1 min. Baseline was adjusted for positional changes and temporal drift. All episodes were verified, with the use of the ECG monitor printout (ECG complexes), by two independent blinded investigators. Clinical care was not controlled by study protocol, and clinicians were unaware of the research data collected. Twenty-six of 50 patients (52%) had 207 episodes of perioperative ischemia (3,409 ischemic minutes). Postoperatively, ischemia developed in 48% of patients, compared with 12% preoperatively and 10% intraoperatively before bypass. Postoperative ischemia was most common in the early period (postoperative days [PODs] 0-2; 38% of patients), peaking during the first 2 h after revascularization, and less common during the late postoperative period (PODs 3-7; 24% of patients). Almost all (120 of 122; 98%) postoperative episodes (after tracheal extubation) were asymptomatic: only 9 of 70 (13%) early episodes were detected by clinical ECG monitoring. Postoperative ischemia did not appear to be related to acute changes in myocardial oxygen demand: only 39% of the postoperative episodes were preceded by a greater than 20% increase in heart rate. However, tachycardia persisted throughout the postoperative week (22-33% of all heart rates greater than 100 beats per min), and patients with postoperative ischemia (POD 0) more frequently had tachycardia (median 43% vs. 12% of the time; P less than 0.01). Five adverse cardiac outcomes occurred on the day of surgery; all five were preceded by postoperative ischemia, three by intraoperative ischemia before bypass, and none by preoperative ischemia. Patients with late postoperative ischemia did not have an adverse cardiac outcome. The authors conclude the following: 1) ischemia is more prevalent postoperatively than preoperatively or intraoperatively before bypass; 2) the incidence of postoperative ischemia peaks shortly after revascularization, during which time it is symptomatically silent, difficult to detect, and related to adverse cardiac outcome; 3) late postoperative ischemia also is silent, but it is less prevalent and not associated with in-hospital adverse cardiac outcome; and 4) a relationship between ischemia and persistently elevated postoperative heart rate may exist and warrants additional investigation. 
7.Cathepsins D and E in normal, metaplastic, dysplastic, and carcinomatous gastric tissue: an immunohistochemical study. Immunohistochemical distributions of cathepsins D and E were determined in normal mucosa, metaplastic, dysplastic, and cancerous lesions of the human stomach. Cathepsins D and E were localised in the foveolar epithelium and parietal cells of the normal gastric mucosa, but their intracytoplasmic distributions were different - cathepsin E distribution was even and diffuse in the cytoplasm while cathepsin D was found in coarse intracytoplasmic granules. Chronic inflammation and ulcer did not influence the distribution of these enzymes. No positive staining was obtained in the incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumour cells of signet ring cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells, however, gave strong and diffuse stainings for cathepsins D and E in the cytoplasm. The results suggest that the distribution of cathepsins D and E is related to each specialised function of the foveolar epithelium and the parietal cells, and that their disappearance is associated with development of well differentiated adenocarcinoma from intestinal metaplasia. 
8.Neurological sequelae of cerebral malaria in children. Out of 604 Gambian children admitted with falciparum malaria to one hospital between September and December, 1988, 308 had cerebral malaria and 203 were severely anaemic (haemoglobin less than 60 g/l). 14% of those with cerebral malaria died, as did 7.8% of those with severe anaemia. 32 (12%) of children surviving cerebral malaria had residual neurological deficit. 69 other children were admitted with clinical features strongly suggestive of cerebral malaria but with negative blood films; 16 of these died and 3 had residual neurological deficits. The commonest sequelae of cerebral malaria were hemiplegia (23 cases), cortical blindness (11), aphasia (9), and ataxia (6). Factors predisposing to sequelae included prolonged coma, protracted convulsions, severe anaemia, and a biphasic clinical course characterised by recovery of consciousness followed by recurrent convulsions and coma. At follow up 1-6 months later over half these children had made a full recovery, but a quarter were left with a major residual neurological deficit. Cerebral malaria in childhood may be an important cause of neurological handicap in the tropics. 
9.Environmental risk factors in siblings with Parkinson's disease. To investigate possible risk factors in Parkinson's disease, we conducted a case-controlled study of 19 families having two or more siblings with Parkinson's disease. Demographic data were collected, including lifetime histories of places of residence; sources of drinking water; occupations, such as farming; and exposure to herbicides and pesticides. Rural living and drinking well water, but not farming and herbicide exposure, were significantly increased in 38 parkinsonians compared with 38 normal control subjects. A comparison of parkinsonian siblings with siblings with essential tremor revealed no differences in any risk factors for the years of shared environment. These data suggest that living in a rural environment and drinking well water are risk factors for Parkinson's disease and that the total life exposure to an environmental toxin may be more important than exposure in early life. 
10.Hemangiopericytoma of the sternum. Hemangiopericytoma of the chest wall is a rare tumor. We describe a patient with malignant hemangiopericytoma of the sternum who was treated with primary surgical resection and discuss the clinical, radiographic, and histologic features of the case. Surgical resection is the primary mode of therapy. High-dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy with a doxorubicin hydrochloride-containing combination may be warranted in certain cases.
