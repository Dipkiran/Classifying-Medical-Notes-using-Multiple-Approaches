Give downloadable output in CSV format, where the first column would be the note that I give as an input, and the second column will be one of the five categories associated with notes. Please do not write any explanations. 

Classify the following notes:
1.Effect of nicardipine on somatosensory evoked potentials in patients with acute cerebral infarction. We evaluated the effect of nicardipine, a calcium channel blocker, on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in 26 patients with acute cerebral infarction. Post treatment, 58% (15/26) of the N20 and P25 latencies were prolonged in the affected hemispheres; 8% (2/26) were shortened; and 35% (9/26) did not change. The mean N20 and P25 latencies were significantly prolonged two hours post treatment in the affected hemisphere (N20, P less than 0.01, P25 P less than 0.01). Nicardipine (Ni) had no effect on SEP components in the intact hemispheres. Seventy five per cent of the 12 patients with hypertension had a decrease in blood pressure (BP) after taking nicardipine, but there were no undesirable side effects or worsening of neurological signs. Our study demonstrates that nicardipine prolongs the latencies of short-latency components of SEP in the affected hemisphere after acute ischaemic stroke and also decreases BP. These observations suggest that nicardipine therapy might impair neuronal function in the ischaemic zone. 
2.Modulatory action of adenosine on gastric function and ethanol-induced mucosal damage in rats. This study examines the gastric effects of adenosine and its antagonist, theophylline, on secretory function, mucosal blood flow, and on ethanol-induced glandular mucosal damage in rats that were fasted for 24 hr before experimentation. The animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and their tracheae cannulated. An ex vivo stomach chamber then was prepared. The luminal bathing solution was collected every 15 min and the concentrations of H+ and Na+ were determined by a pH autotitrator and an ionmeter, respectively. The glandular mucosal blood flow was measured by a laser Doppler flowmeter and the severity of lesions was determined by measuring the hemorrhagic areas. Adenosine administration (2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg, subcutaneous) markedly lowered the H+ and Na+ output but increased the secretory volume and mucosal blood flow in a dose-dependent manner. The same doses of the nucleoside also prevented ethanol-induced mucosal damage. These effects were prevented by pretreatment with theophylline (30 or 60 mg/kg, subcutaneous). Ethanol given alone significantly depressed the H+ and Na+ secretion. Both effects were not modified by adenosine treatment. However, the depressive action of ethanol on mucosal blood flow was prevented by adenosine. These findings indicate that adenosine modulates the physiological function of the stomach. It also directly activates the defensive mechanism of the stomach, which is partially mediated by the improvement of the gastric mucosal blood flow and an increase in the nonacid component of gastric secretion. 
3.Pancreatic response to percutaneous biliary drainage: a prospective study. To evaluate the effects of percutaneous biliary drainage (PBD) on the pancreas, serum amylase levels were measured for 7 consecutive days after PBD and compared with baseline values in 50 patients who underwent a total of 53 PBD procedures. Of the 45 patients with normal baseline serum amylase levels, 12 patients (24%) developed postprocedural hyperamylasemia without clinical symptoms and five patients (10%) developed postprocedural hyperamylasemia with clinical signs of pancreatitis. Five patients who presented with elevated baseline serum amylase levels demonstrated decreases into the normal range after placement of stents without initiation of bowel rest or liquid diet. The level of biliary obstruction proved insignificant, as did the nature of the obstructing disease, in determining which patients would experience hyperamylasemia or pancreatitis after PBD. It is concluded that the frequency of pancreatic insult from PBD may be more common than previously reported and that patient susceptibility is not dependent on the level of biliary obstruction or the nature of the disease. 
4.Laparoscopic cholecystectomy using intracorporeal lithotripsy. Over a 13-month period (November 1988 to December 1989), we performed our first 104 laparoscopic cholecystectomies using an intracorporeal ultrasonic lithotripsy technique. The procedure in three of these patients was converted to an open operation because of hemorrhage with unexpected findings of cirrhosis in two patients and dense subhepatic adhesions in a third. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully used in three other patients in whom common bile duct stones were identified. We encountered only three postoperative complications out of all the laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed. One complication was a biliary fistula that closed spontaneously 1 week after surgery. The remaining complications were attributable to abscesses, one subhepatic and one pelvic, which were aspirated and drained laparoscopically. There were no deaths. Advantages of the laparoscopic approach included decreased perioperative pain, shortened hospitalization, absence of scar, and more rapid return to prehospitalization activities. 
5.Obstruction of mechanical heart valve prostheses: clinical aspects and surgical management. One hundred patients (32 male) aged 5 months to 82 years (median 32 years) underwent 106 surgical procedures for 112 mechanical prosthetic valves obstructed by a thrombus (n = 61) or pannus (n = 7), or both (n = 44), between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1989. The position of the obstructed prosthesis was aortic in 51 patients (48%), mitral in 49 (46%) and both aortic and mitral in 6 (6%). The types of obstructed prosthetic valves were Bjork-Shiley (n = 51), St. Jude (n = 41) and Medtronic-Hall (n = 20). The time interval between valve replacement and obstruction ranged from 6 weeks to 13 years (median 4 years). Of 63% of patients in whom coagulation variables were available at the time of obstruction, 70% were receiving inadequate anticoagulant therapy. In 63% of the procedures the patient was in New York Heart Association functional class IV. Two patients underwent preoperative thrombolysis with incomplete results. Operative procedures included valve replacement (n = 81), valve declotting and excision of pannus (n = 23) and aortic valve replacement and mitral valve declotting (n = 2). The early mortality rate was 12.3% (13 patients), and there was no difference between surgery for mitral prostheses (12.2%) versus aortic prostheses (13.7%). The perioperative mortality rate was 17.5% (11 of 63 patients) in patients in functional class IV and 4.7% (2 of 43 patients) in those in functional classes I to III (p less than 0.05). For valve replacement, the mortality rate was 12% (10 of 81 patients) and for declotting of the prosthesis 13% (3 of 23 patients). 
6.Factors affecting the enterohepatic circulation of oral contraceptive steroids. Oral contraceptive steroids may undergo enterohepatic circulation, but it is relevant for only estrogens, because these compounds can be directly conjugated in the liver. Animal studies show convincing evidence of the importance of the enterohepatic circulation, but studies in humans are much less convincing. The importance of the route and the rate of metabolism of ethinyl estradiol are reviewed. Some antibiotics have been reported anecdotally to reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptive steroids, but controlled studies have not confirmed this observation. Although gut flora are altered by oral antibiotics, the blood levels of ethinyl estradiol are not reduced, and one antibiotic at least (cotrimoxazole) enhances the activity of ethinyl estradiol. 
7.Bacterial or viral meningitis? Measuring lactate in CSF can help you know quickly. Measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate is a useful test when properly applied to the appropriate clinical situation and can offer information other CSF parameters cannot provide. Except for Gram's stain of CSF, lactate level is the most important CSF parameter in the early differentiation of viral (aseptic) and bacterial purulent meningitis. 
8.The relationship of Papanicolaou testing and contacts with the medical care system to stage at diagnosis of cervical cancer. The relationship of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing and physician visits to stage at diagnosis of cervical cancer was assessed by interviews with 149 women with invasive cervical cancer and 214 women with in situ cervical cancer. A significantly smaller percent of study subjects with invasive disease than in situ disease had at least one Pap test in the 3 years prior to diagnosis (age- and race-adjusted odds ratio: 3.38). The two groups did not differ in visits to a physician for other reasons during this period. Pap testing decreased with increasing age for both groups, but not physician visits. While 65% percent of the subjects with invasive disease aged between 65 and 79 years had never had a Pap test until diagnosis, 88% had seen a physician in the preceding 3 years. Women with regional or distant invasive disease were least likely to have had Pap tests, and, within this group, those aged between 35 and 64 years were also least likely to have seen a physician. Strategies for early detection must reflect missed opportunities and the need to bring those not receiving care into the system. 
9.Acute myocardial infarction and chest pain syndromes after cocaine use. Seventy patients hospitalized with chest pain after cocaine use were retrospectively evaluated to define the risk and clinical course of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). AMI developed in 22 patients (31%) and transient myocardial ischemia was seen in an additional 9 patients (13%). Coronary risk factors did not distinguish those who developed AMI from those who did not. The presenting electrocardiogram was abnormal in 20 of 22 patients who evolved AMI and in 19 of 48 of those who did not. Creatine kinase levels were elevated in 75% of the patients, including 65% of those who did not develop AMI, but creatine kinase-MB elevations were only observed in the AMI group. The route of cocaine administration did not predict AMI and there was no predilection for a particular coronary vascular bed. The length of time between drug use and onset of AMI pain was often quite prolonged (median interval, 18 vs 1 hour in the non-AMI group). Eight of the patients with AMI underwent cardiac catheterization and 4 had significant coronary narrowing. 
10.Yersinia enterocolitica abscess of the transverse colon. Report of a case. Yersinia enterocolitica abscess of the bowel is a rare entity. Only five cases have previously been reported--none in the surgical literature. A unique presentation for Yersinia infection, abscess of the transverse colon, is described, and the literature of Y. enterocolitica intestinal perforation and abscess is reviewed.
