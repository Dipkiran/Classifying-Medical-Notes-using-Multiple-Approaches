1.Effect of V1-vasopressin receptor blockade on arterial pressure in conscious rats with cirrhosis and ascites. Angiotensin II blockade with saralasin in human cirrhosis with ascites is associated with a significant reduction in arterial pressure, indicating that endogenous angiotensin II plays an important role in the maintenance of systemic hemodynamics in this condition. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether vasopressin also contributes to the maintenance of arterial pressure in cirrhosis with ascites. The study was performed using three groups of cirrhotic rats with ascites and three groups of control animals. The administration of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP, a selective antagonist of the vascular effect of vasopressin, to 10 cirrhotic rats induced a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (from 94 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 4 mm Hg; P less than 0.001) and a significant increase in plasma renin activity (from 24.3 +/- 4.9 to 34.3 +/- 5.9 ng/mL.h; P less than 0.02) and plasma norepinephrine concentration (from 1474 +/- 133 to 2433 +/- 253 pg/mL; P less than 0.01). Similar results were observed following saralasin administration in a second group of 5 cirrhotic rats [mean arterial pressure decreased from 97 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than 0.0001); and plasma renin activity and norepinephrine concentration increased from 18.4 +/- 5.8 to 40.3 +/- 5.7 ng/mL.h (P less than 0.02) and from 1383 +/- 70 to 2312 +/- 334 pg/mL (P less than 0.05), respectively]. The simultaneous blockade of angiotensin II and vasopressin in a third group of cirrhotic rats resulted in a significantly greater reduction of mean arterial pressure (from 97 +/- 6 to 74 +/- 6 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). No changes in arterial pressure were observed in the three groups of control rats. These findings indicate that endogenous vasopressin is as important as angiotensin II in the maintenance of arterial pressure in cirrhotic rats with ascites and support the contention that arterial hypotension is the initial event leading to the stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system and vasopressin in this animal model of cirrhosis. 
2.Clinical evaluation of a side entry access port: a novel dual-lumen venous access device. The initial clinical experience with a low-profile side entry access (SEA) dual-lumen implantable venous access port for cancer chemotherapy administration is summarized in this report. The catheter material is polyurethane. The overall experience in 35 patients in this study was a total of 6,224 patient days, with a mean of 178 days per patient. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents, biologic response modifiers, and antibiotics were administered. In 26% of the patients, the device chambers were in simultaneous use during the treatment period. A 6% incidence of clinical subclavian vein thrombosis was noted. There was no infectious complications. Inconsistencies in blood withdrawal and temporary catheter dysfunction were comparable to other access ports in clinical use. The novel design of this side entry port and the catheter material of low thrombogenicity make this device a good option in patients requiring a low-profile system and dual access. Nursing staff should be made aware of the side entry design and that in-service training for accessing the septum is required in centers where such devices are not routinely used. 
3.Variable expression of Parkinson's disease: a base-line analysis of the DATATOP cohort. The Parkinson Study Group. The DATATOP database, which includes clinical information on 800 patients with early untreated Parkinson's disease (PD), is well suited to explore clinical heterogeneity in PD. Patients with early-onset PD (less than or equal to 40 years, N = 33) reached the same level of disability as the late-onset PD (greater than or equal to 70 years, N = 85) group at a significantly slower rate (2.9 vs. 1.7 years). Early-onset PD patients functioned cognitively better than late-onset PD patients. Bradykinesia, and postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD), were more common at onset in patients with a rapid rate of disease progression ("malignant PD"; duration of symptoms less than 1 year and Hoehn/Yahr stage of 2.5, N = 11) as compared with those with a relatively slow rate of progression ("benign PD"; duration of symptoms greater than 4 years, N = 65). Comparisons of tremor-dominant PD (mean tremor score/mean PIGD score less than or equal to 1.5, N = 441) with the PIGD-dominant type (mean tremor score/mean PIGD score greater than or equal to 1.0, N = 233) provided support for the existence of clinical subtypes. The PIGD group reported significantly greater subjective intellectual, motor, and occupational impairment than the tremor group. Stage II patients had higher depression scores than stage I patients. Among the patients participating in the DATATOP, older age at onset with bradykinesia, or with the PIGD form of PD, is associated with more functional disability than when the symptoms are dominated by tremor or begin at a younger age. 
4.Increase of calmodulin activator in hypertension. Modulation by dietary sodium and calcium. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary calcium and sodium on blood pressure (BP) in normotensive rats (Wistar, WKY), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl rats and on calmodulin (CaM) activator, a newly-discovered hydrophobic compound that increases CaM activity in SHR and spontaneously hypertensive mice (SHM) tissues (J Clin Invest 82:276, 1988). The CaM activator was assessed by its capacity to stimulate a CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE). In Wistar rats, which were fed a high sodium diet (3.5%), BP significantly increased (P less than .01) from 106 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 8 mm Hg in parallel to an elevation of the CaM activator from 1.57 +/- 0.14 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 U. WKY, SHR, and Dahl salt-sensitive (DS/JR) and salt-resistant (DR/JR) rats were given low (0.15%) or high (2.5%) Ca diets, both with 1% sodium. In rats receiving high dietary Ca the progression of hypertension diminished and BP was lower in SHR (156 +/- 4 mm Hg) and young DS/JR rats (125 +/- 3 mm Hg) than in those receiving low dietary Ca (192 +/- 10 and 183 +/- 2 mm Hg). There was a concomitant decrease of CaM activator in these animals to levels indistinguishable from those of WKY or DR/JR rats. The activator was also found in the heart, kidneys and erythrocytes from SHM. In the presence of exogenously added CaM, lipidic extracts from the SHM heart showed augmented CaM-PDE activity relative to normotensive preparations. This difference was eliminated by trifluoperazine. 
5.Management of subglottic stenosis in the adult. Twenty-one adult patients were surgically treated for severe subglottic stenosis refractory to endoscopic treatment. Patients were treated by anterior or anterior and posterior cricoid division with costal cartilage grafting. Seventy-six percent of the patients were successfully decannulated. Success of treatment was not dependent on cause of the stenosis or age or sex of the patient. There was a significantly better outcome (p less than .05) in patients with isolated subglottic stenosis versus those with combined glottic and subglottic stenosis. 
6.Multiple myeloma and acute megakaryoblast leukemia in spent phase polycythemia vera. The spontaneous and simultaneous occurrence of multiple myeloma and megakaryoblast leukemia with myelodysplastic features in a case of spent phase polycythemia vera is well documented. In support of the morphologic characteristics of the bone marrow, immunocytologic studies show proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells and megakaryoblasts. The cytogenetic findings of 20q- and unbalanced t(1;7) are consistent with myelodysplastic and leukemic transformation of the bone marrow. These transformations expand observations on variable and spontaneous lineage commitments as the consequence of alterations of the hematopoietic stem cell clone. These data are in support of the changing insights in hematopoiesis as a process of ordered commitment of the stem cell with sequential lineage potentials. 
7.Mitral valve repair by replacement of chordae tendineae with polytetrafluoroethylene sutures. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sutures have been used for replacement of diseased chordae tendineae during reconstructive procedures on the mitral valve in 43 patients. There were 28 men and 15 women whose mean age was 55 years, range 21 to 76. Three fourths of the patients were in New York Heart Association class III or IV. Replacement of primary chordae tendineae of the anterior leaflet was performed with 4-0 or 5-0 polytetrafluoroethylene sutures. A double-armed suture was passed twice through the fibrous portion of the papillary muscle head and tied down. Each arm of the suture was brought up to the free margin of the leaflet and passed through the area where the native chorda was attached. After the lengths of the two arms were adjusted, the ends were tied together on the ventricular side of the leaflet. Thirty patients had degenerative disease of the mitral valve; the incompetence was due to prolapse of the anterior leaflet in 14 patients and prolapse of the anterior and posterior leaflets in 16. Eleven patients had rheumatic mitral valve disease: four had stenosis, three had regurgitation, and four had mixed lesions. Two patients had ischemic mitral regurgitation caused by rupture of a papillary muscle head. There were no operative deaths. Patients have been followed up from 5 to 61 months, mean 13. Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed at regular intervals after the operation and revealed normal mitral valve function in most patients There were two failures that necessitated mitral valve replacement: one because of acute mitral regurgitation and the other because of hemolysis. There have been two late deaths, neither one valve related. Replacement of chordae tendineae with polytetrafluoroethylene sutures is simple and allows for reconstruction of the mitral valve in many patients who would otherwise require mitral valve replacement. Because our patients have been followed up for a limited time, the long-term results of this procedure remain unknown. 
8.Association of bcl-1 rearrangements with lymphocytic lymphoma of intermediate differentiation. Previous studies using classical cytogenetics have demonstrated the presence of the t(11;14) (q13;q32) chromosomal translocation in some cases of lymphocytic lymphoma of intermediate differentiation (IDL), a distinct type of low grade B-cell lymphoma. This finding suggested that the bcl-1 region (located at band q13 of chromosome 11) might be involved in this neoplasm. Using a genomic probe from the major breakpoint area of the bcl-1 locus, we identified rearrangements of the bcl-1 region in 10 of 19 cases, 2 of which comigrated with a rearranged allele of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene joining region. In contrast, bcl-1 rearrangements were not found in other types of low grade B-cell lymphoma, specifically in 36 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and 27 cases of follicular lymphoma (FL). To further assess the molecular pathology of IDL, we analyzed these cases for rearrangements of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene, which is associated primarily with follicular lymphomas. None of the 19 cases of IDL had rearrangements. Furthermore, none of the 36 cases of CLL/SLL showed bcl-2 rearrangements, whereas, as expected, 21 of 27 cases of FL had rearrangements of the bcl-2 locus. Our findings demonstrate an association between a rearranged bcl-1 region with approximately 50% of IDLs and suggest that abnormalities of this locus may be important in the pathogenesis of IDL. 
9.Discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs in children who have outgrown epilepsy: effects on cognitive function. Cognitive function is frequently impaired in children with epilepsy, compared with age-matched controls. It can be hard to evaluate the significance of various contributory factors. The effects of antiepileptic drugs may be studied in children who have outgrown their epilepsy but are still being treated. A multicenter study to assess various aspects of cognitive function in children with different forms of epilepsy, both during and after treatment with antiepileptic drugs, is currently under way. Definitive results are not yet available; interim analysis of the findings suggests that short-term memory is decreased in all subgroups of children being treated for epilepsy, compared to controls. 
10.Endometrial ablation for the treatment of menorrhagia: a comparison of patients with normal, enlarged, and fibroid uteri. One hundred sixty-one patients underwent endometrial ablation with the Nd:YAG laser for the treatment of refractory menorrhagia. Patients were divided into one of three groups: those with a normal-sized uterus; those with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm); and those with uterine fibroids, which had been documented clinically, ultrasonographically, or by a combination of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy or by one or the other. All patients were considered candidates for hysterectomy. Both preoperatively and postoperatively, patients monitored their menstrual cycles and evaluated their flow according to predetermined categories of amenorrhea, light flow, normal flow, heavy flow, and severe flow. After treatment, 68% of patients with normal-sized uterus and 91% of patients with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm) and 88% of patients with uterine fibroids became amenorrheic or had light flow. None of the patients in this last group have had to undergo hysterectomy. This study indicates that the patient with an enlarged or fibroid uterus may not have contraindications for endometrial ablation. Endometrial ablation may be effective in at least temporarily controlling bleeding in those patients with enlarged or myomatous uterus.
