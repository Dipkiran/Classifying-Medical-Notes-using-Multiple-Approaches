You are a health professional, and you are classifying medical notes in one of the five categories: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, and general pathological conditions. 

Give downloadable output in CSV format, where the first column would be the note that I give as an input, and the second column will be one of the five categories associated with notes. Please do not write any explanations. 

Classify the following notes:
1.Prognostic factors in the treatment of alopecia areata with diphenylcyclopropenone. One hundred thirty-nine patients with alopecia areata were treated with diphenylcyclopropenone. Before treatment, 85 patients had subtotal or total hair loss (greater than 90% bald area) and in the remaining patients scalp involvement was between 40% and 90%. The following three factors were found to be of prognostic significance: type of alopecia areata as documented before treatment, duration of the disease before therapy, and presence of nail changes. Other factors such as age at onset, sex, presence of atopic features, the extent of variation in the range of diphenylcyclopropenone concentrations during treatment, and sleep disturbances caused by pruritus did not influence the prognosis significantly. 
2.Dynamic association between artery shear flow condition and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in human hypertension. 1. Blood cells and vascular endothelial cells are subjected to a wide range of haemodynamically generated shear stress forces. In vitro, membrane stretching or shear stress have been observed to activate ion channels and cell metabolism and to facilitate erythrocyte and platelet aggregation. 2. The present study was designed to evaluate the participation of shear stresses in the control of apparent platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in hypertensive patients. 3. Shear conditions and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro were studied after a dynamic perturbation induced by 3 months of double-blind treatment with one of two beta-antagonists, carteolol and atenolol. Brachial artery wall shear rate and stress were estimated by means of a pulsed Doppler velocimeter, and blood viscosity was measured by a co-axial viscometer at a shear rate of 96 s-1. Platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was simultaneously measured by using the Quin-2 fluorescent chelator. The direct effect of atenolol and carteolol on platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in vitro was also measured after addition of the beta-blockers to platelet-rich plasma. 4. Atenolol and carteolol decreased blood pressure similarly but their effects on shear rate (P less than 0.02), shear stress (P less than 0.01) and platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (P less than 0.05) differed after 3 months of therapy. In contrast, neither of the drugs significantly altered platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, in vitro per se. 5. In the overall population, strong positive correlations existed not only between changes in platelet cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and those in shear rate (r = 0.81, P less than 0.001) and shear stress (r = 0.83, P less than 0.001), but also between their absolute values, suggesting a possible haemodynamic shear-dependent modulation of transmembrane Ca2+ transport. 
3.Continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs for filling and lining the post-exenteration pelvis. Pelvic exenteration has a high complication rate due, in large part, to the extensive raw surfaces and dead space it creates. Numerous techniques have been used to control this space and line these surfaces, but none, to date, has proven to be a reliable solution. We investigated the use of continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs as a new "flap" to fill and line the pelvis in 17 patients, and found that our historical complication rate of 44% for pelvic exenteration was reduced to 18%. These reservoirs appear to be an improved method of managing the post-exenteration pelvis. 
4.Response rates in relapsed Wilms' tumor. A need for new effective agents. Three hundred eighty-one children with Wilms' tumor were treated in the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group WT1 Study (1982 to 1986). Seventy-one patients had relapses during or after treatment with surgery and chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, depending on stage and histologic characteristics. Forty-nine patients were evaluable for disease response to second-line chemotherapy alone. Evaluation of response to chemotherapy was impossible in the remaining patients because either surgery or radiation therapy was used at the time of relapse. With second-line combination chemotherapy (which included ifosfamide, etoposide/VM26, cisplatin/carboplatin, bleomycin, melphalan, and Thiotepa [Lederle Laboratories, Pearl River, NY]), there were five complete responses and 12 partial responses. In patients with favorable histologic findings, six of nine with Stage I, five of ten with Stage II, none of 11 with Stage III, three of 16 with Stage IV, and one of five with Stage V disease survived. Two survivors were treated with chemotherapy alone; the others received combined treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery. For those with unfavorable histologic findings of any stage, only two of 20 survived. The authors conclude that, even for patients with localized disease with favorable histologic findings, the "salvage" rate is little more than 50%, and for all other stages and histologic findings the likelihood of cure after relapse is remote. There is clearly a need for additional effective chemotherapeutic agents for these patients. 
5.Induction of inflammatory cell infiltration and necrosis in normal mouse skin by the combined treatment of tumor necrosis factor and lithium chloride. Previously we reported that lithium chloride (LiCl) potentiates tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Here, using a murine normal skin model, it is shown that a subcutaneous injection of TNF plus LiCl induces acute dermal and subcutaneous inflammation and necrosis. Histology showed a marked initial dermal and subcutaneous neutrophil infiltrate by approximately 2 hours, followed by a predominantly mononuclear infiltrate by 24 hours, which remained present for several days. Tumor necrosis factor or LiCl alone induced negligible inflammation, disappearing after 6 hours; furthermore there was never necrosis or ulceration of the overlying skin in case of single-agent application. In vitro studies showed that the combination of TNF and LiCl, but not either agent alone, was directly cytotoxic to fibroblastic cells of murine skin. No inflammatory infiltration was visible in tumors treated intratumorally or perilesionally with TNF plus LiCl, although the latter treatment resulted in a perilesional leukocyte infiltration. Furthermore the combination of TNF and LiCl had no effect on macrophage cytotoxicity to L929 tumors. 
6.Absorption and motility of the bypassed human ileum. The authors assessed absorption and motility of the human ileum after a prolonged period of disuse. In eight patients with ulcerative colitis, a manometric-catheter assembly was placed via the ileostomy into the unused portion of distal ileum two months after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and temporary diverting loop ileostomy. The distal ileum was perfused at 5 ml/min with an isosmotic solution of either sodium chloride or ileal chyme diluted with sodium chloride for three hours before and three hours after a meal on two consecutive days. Absorption was measured, single and clustered pressure waves were identified and quantitated with the aid of a computer program, and a motility index was calculated. Mean absorption +/- S.E.M. of both perfusates was poor on day 1 (-10 +/- 2 ml/25 cm x 30 min), and the meal induced no ileal motor response. By day 2, however, absorption of both perfusates was much improved (-1 +/- 2 ml/25 cm x 30 min; P less than 0.05), and the number of discrete clustered contractions and the motility index now clearly increased after the meal (2.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 7.2 +/- 1.0 clustered waves/hr; 7.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.7 +/- 0.2 motility units/30 min; P less than 0.05). The conclusion was that absorption and motility of the human ileum were impaired after two months of disuse, but that ileal absorption and motility improved one day after the introduction of isosmotic ileal perfusates. 
7.Temporal bone: three-dimensional CT. Part II. Pathologic alterations. Three-dimensional (3D) surface renderings were obtained from routine axial computed tomographic (CT) images in 15 patients with a variety of complex temporal bone abnormalities. The 3D CT reformations served as an adjunct to conventional sectional CT examination. While no diagnosis was substantially changed because of the 3D CT images, they did provide a more global perspective in cases of large tumors and fractures and at the postmastoidectomy site. Three-dimensional CT surface reformations are now practical and may be potentially useful for visualizing temporal bone lesions characterized by complex destructive change. 
8.Comparative studies of DU-PAN-2, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9 in the serum and bile of patients with pancreatic and biliary tract diseases: evaluation of the influence of obstructive jaundice. The levels of DU-PAN-2 antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9 in serum and bile of patients with pancreatic and biliary tract diseases were measured. The sensitivities (true positive) of DU-PAN-2 in serum to pancreatic carcinoma (64%) and to biliary tract carcinoma (62%) were similar to those of CA19-9 in serum (69% and 72%, respectively). Nine of 18 (50%) patients with CA19-9-negative pancreatic carcinoma tested positive for DU-PAN-2. The sensitivities of CEA to pancreatic carcinoma (56%) and to biliary tract carcinoma (52%) were lowest. The measurement of these antigens in bile seemed to be of little diagnostic value in differentiating between malignant and benign diseases. False positives of these three assays occurred frequently in patients with benign pancreatic or biliary tract disease coupled with obstructive jaundice. After percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, serum DU-PAN-2 and CA19-9 levels returned to normal ranges in patients with benign diseases, but not in patients with carcinoma of the pancreas or of the biliary tract. Serum CA19-9 and DU-PAN-2 antigens are useful tumor markers for pancreatic and biliary tract carcinomas. Longitudinal assays of these antigens may be useful for the differential diagnosis of patients with obstructive jaundice. 
9.Lower extremity weakness as the initial manifestation of lung cancer [published erratum appears in Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1991 Jan;72(1):61] A 55-year-old woman had progressive lower extremity weakness. She had an 80-pack-per-year history of cigarette smoking. Electromyographic findings were consistent with the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Despite a normal chest x-ray, normal laboratory studies, and negative bronchoscopy, investigation for lung cancer was pursued. The final thoracotomy and pathology reports indicated a diagnosis of oat cell carcinoma. After treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, clinical and electrophysiologic findings have resolved. Two years after diagnosis, the patient remains in good health without evidence of recurrence. 
10.Circulating heart-reactive antibodies in patients with myocarditis or cardiomyopathy [corrected and republished with original paging, article originally printed in J Am Coll Cardiol 1990 Oct;16(4):839-46] Heart-reactive antibodies are commonly observed in patients with myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Such antibodies may be important in the pathogenesis of these disorders, yet the specific antigens recognized have not been studied systematically. This report characterizes circulating heart autoantibodies from patients with myocarditis (n = 17) or idiopathic cardiomyopathy (n = 71) and from healthy volunteers (n = 15). Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that high titer (greater than or equal to 1:20) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody activity occurred in 59% of the myocarditis samples, 20% of the cardiomyopathy samples and none of the normal samples. All samples were tested by Western immunoblotting for IgG activity against a normal human heart extract. The number of antigens recognized by each sample was enumerated and the molecular weight of each antigen estimated; the prevalence of reactivity against antigens in selected molecular weight classes was determined. There was no difference in the mean number of heart antigens recognized by serum from each group. For most weight classes, prevalence either did not differ significantly among the various groups or subgroups or was greatest among samples from healthy volunteers. Prevalence of reactivity with 190 to 199 kilodalton (kd) antigens was greatest (p less than 0.05) among low titer serum samples from patients with myocarditis. High titer cardiomyopathy serum differed from normal serum by an increased (p less than 0.05) prevalence of antibodies to 40 to 49 and 100 to 109 kd antigens. These results suggest that western immunostaining may ultimately contribute substantively to identifying patients with myocarditis or cardiomyopathy.
