You are a health professional, and you are classifying medical notes in one of the five categories: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, and general pathological conditions. 

Give downloadable output in CSV format, where the first column would be the note that I give as an input, and the second column will be one of the five categories associated with notes. Please do not write any explanations. 

Classify the following notes:
1.Genital herpes simplex virus infections. There has been a dramatic increase in patient visits to physicians for evaluation and treatment of genital herpes infections. This has resulted in part from an increase in genital herpes infections, particularly severe, first-episode genital herpes infections in adults without prior HSV-1 infection. Virus culture remains the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosis, and use of viral cultures is encouraged. Type-specific antibody tests have been employed in studies documenting the role of asymptomatic shedding of HSV in transmission of genital infections, the role of genital HSV in transmission of HIV, the predominance of asymptomatic and unrecognized infections in those infected with HSV-2, and the presence of past asymptomatic or unrecognized acquisition of HSV-2 in 25% of persons presenting with first-episode genital herpes. Unfortunately, commercially available serologic tests do not reliably differentiate between antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2. Recent studies suggest that the annual risk of transmission from a sexual partner with genital herpes is about 10% in heterosexual couples. Currently, promotion of "safe sex" is the only available approach for prevention of transmission. However, ongoing research is focused on the development of an effective vaccine. Acyclovir should be used routinely in persons with first-episode genital herpes, but careful evaluation is needed in persons with recurrent genital herpes to determine whether episodic or suppressive treatment is indicated. Acyclovir should also be used routinely for episodic or suppressive treatment of HSV infections in persons with AIDS. Additional antiviral agents are needed for more effective suppressive therapy and for treatment of ACV-resistant HSV infections in the immunocompromised host. 
2.Doppler echocardiographic assessment of the St. Jude Medical prosthetic valve in the aortic position using the continuity equation. To test whether the continuity equation can be applied to the noninvasive assessment of prosthetic aortic valve function, Doppler echocardiography was performed in 67 patients (mean age, 58 +/- 14 years) within 10 +/- 6 days after valve replacement with St. Jude Medical valves. All patients were clinically stable and without evidence of valve dysfunction. Valve size ranged from 19 to 31 mm, and ejection fraction ranged from 30% to 75%. With the parasternal long-axis view, the left ventricular outflow diameter measured just proximal to the prosthetic valve correlated well with valve size (r = 0.92). Doppler-derived maximal gradients ranged from 9 to 71 mm Hg. Effective prosthetic aortic valve area by the continuity equation ranged between 0.73 cm2 for a 19-mm valve and 4.23 cm2 for a 31-mm valve. With analysis of variance, effective orifice area differentiated various valve sizes (p less than 10(-14)) better than did gradients alone (p = 0.003) and correlated better with actual valve orifice area (r = 0.83 versus - 0.40). A Doppler velocity index, the ratio of peak velocity in the left ventricular outflow to that of the aortic jet, averaged 0.41 +/- 0.09 and was less dependent on valve size (r = 0.43). Thus, the continuity equation can be applied to the assessment of prosthetic St. Jude valves in the aortic position. By accounting for flow through the valve, it provides an improved assessment over the sole use of gradients in the evaluation of prosthetic valve function. 
3.Experimental study of starch-induced intraperitoneal adhesions The effects of starch on the development of postoperative adhesions were examined in 144 Sprague Dawley rats. Groups of rats were injected intraperitoneally with suspensions of washings from starched gloves, starch-free gloves and starch-poor washed gloves, and after operative manipulation of the bowel. The incidence of adhesions was greatest (78 per cent) after laparotomy and injections of starch-rich washings and least when starch-poor (33 per cent) or starch-free glove suspensions (37 per cent) were used, confirming an advantage for washing gloves or switching to starch-free products. 
4.Colonoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of ileocecal tuberculosis. Two cases of ileocecal tuberculosis are presented. The diagnosis was achieved by endoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), while endoscopic biopsies and brush cytology were negative. The usefulness of endoscopic FNAC in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract tuberculosis is highlighted. 
5.An epidemic outbreak of cryptosporidiosis: a prospective community study from Guinea Bissau. In the first year of a prospective community study of childhood diarrhea conducted in a semiurban area in the capital of Guinea Bissau, Cryptosporidium sp. was found in 73 (6.0%) of 1216 episodes of diarrhea. The parasite was the second most prevalent intestinal parasite, and the only one significantly associated with diarrhea (OR = 2.79, P = 0.0006). The seasonal distribution was striking, with a peak prevalence in the beginning of the rainy season (May 17.6%) when an epidemic outbreak of diarrhea started. The prevalence was highest in children younger than 18 months, an age at which prevalences of other intestinal parasites were low. This reverse age pattern may possibly be explained by the small infective dose needed to create severe infections, by air-borne transmission and by the development of protective immunity. 
6.Hydromyelic hydrocephalus. Correlation of hydromyelia with various stages of hydrocephalus in postshunt isolated compartments. The clinical features and pathophysiology of specific forms of hydromyelia are analyzed in this report together with the chronological changes of associated hydrocephalus. Nine patients were studied; all had hydromyelia with varying degrees of associated hydrocephalus. Clinically applicable classification systems were used to evaluate the progression of hydrocephalus (Stages I to IV) and to define the compartment isolated after shunting in the previously communicating cerebral ventricles (Types I to IV). Four patients had Stage IV disease (holoneural canal dilatation); one had Stage II and four had Stage I disease (both Stages I and II with supratentorial hydrocephalus). All patients were initially treated by ventriculoperitoneal shunting at an average age of 9.9 years. Five patients had progressive spinal symptoms before or after treatment of their hydrocephalus. Two patients had Type III isolation (an isolated rhombencephalic ventricle) with a functioning ventricular shunt; ventriculography confirmed a communication between the fourth ventricle and the hydromyelia, and both patients improved after placement of a shunt in the fourth ventricle. The remaining patients had Type IV isolation (isolated central canal dilatation) with a functioning ventricular shunt. This study indicates that in some cases the pathophysiology of hydromyelia is closely related to associated hydrocephalus. A new concept of the development of an isolated compartment after shunting is proposed to explain the progression of hydromyelia in these cases. 
7.Quantification of hepatobiliary function as an integral part of imaging with technetium-99m-mebrofenin in health and disease. A study was undertaken to check the feasibility of measuring the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) and excretion T-1/2 values as an integral part of hepatobiliary imaging with technetium-99m-mebrofenin in health and disease. In 18 controls subjects, the HEF was 100% and the T-1/2 excretion mean +/- s.e. value was 15.23 +/- 1.4 min. The mean appearance times of the common bile duct (CBD), gallbladder (GB), and small intestine were 15.8 +/- 1.52, 20.2 +/- 2.7, and 23.8 +/- 3.08 min, respectively. Rising serum bilirubin in patients decreased HEF and increased T-1/2 excretion value resulting in delayed appearance of CBD, GB, and small intestine. In control subjects and patients with bilirubin less than 5 mg%, T-1/2 excretion values at 30, 40, and 50 min were similar to those values calculated using the entire 60 min of data, suggesting that the hepatic phase study time could be reduced to 30-40 min and still use the normal reference values established for 60 min. In patients with bilirubin greater than 5 mg%, the data collection duration should be continued for 60 min. 
8.The cholecystokinin receptor antagonist devazepide enhances morphine-induced analgesia but not morphine-induced respiratory depression in the squirrel monkey. The effects of the cholecystokinin antagonist devazepide on analgesia and respiratory depression induced by morphine in squirrel monkeys were examined. Pain thresholds were determined using the tail withdrawal procedure, in which monkeys restrained in chairs kept their tails in cool (35 degrees C) water for at least 20 sec, but withdrew them from warm (55 degrees C) water in less than 4 sec. Morphine produced a dose-related increase in tail withdrawal latencies from warm water. Devazepide (injected i.p. or p.o.) had no effect on tail withdrawal latencies when given alone but enhanced the analgesic effects of morphine. The devazepide dose-response curve for morphine enhancement was bell-shaped with doses of 3, 10, 30 and 100 micrograms/kg injected i.p. increasing morphine analgesia whereas higher and lower dose did not. In a separate group of monkeys, morphine produced dose-dependent decreases in respiratory rate and oxygen tension and increases in carbon dioxide tension. In contrast to its effects on morphine analgesia, devazepide had no effect on the various indices of morphine-induced respiratory depression. These data suggest that devazepide may have therapeutic utility as an adjuvant to morphine analgesia allowing lower dose of the opiate to be used to relieve pain and reducing the risk of opiate-induced respiratory depression. 
9.The anatomical basis of the caecocentral scotoma. New observations and a review. It is shown that the 'papillomacular bundle' of optic nerve fibres, although a concept discussed frequently in the clinical literature, lacks a clear anatomical definition. It is suggested that the explanation for this is that the 'bundle' was originally described in autopsy studies of toxic amblyopia, not normal anatomy. The optic nerve fibre projection and vascular architecture of the caecocentral region of the retina is described. These anatomical features are discussed in relation to a number of possible anatomical explanations for the fact that a caecocentral scotoma is the characteristic field defect found in toxic amblyopia. We have been unable to identify a distinct anatomical feature which might explain this vulnerability but suggest that the problem has not as yet been clearly addressed by anatomists. 
10.Iliac artery stenosis and occlusion: preliminary results of treatment with Gianturco expandable metallic stents. Ten patients with atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of the iliac artery were treated with Gianturco expandable metallic stents. In the five cases of stenosis, only balloon dilation was performed prior to placement of stents. The five patients with occluded arteries were given intraarterial infusions of urokinase before balloon dilation and stent placement. Clinical symptoms improved in all patients, and no technical failures or complications occurred. Doppler ankle-brachial index studies were performed in nine cases, and in all nine cases the indexes improved after stent placement. During follow-up of 2-18 months (mean, 10.3 months), all arteries remained patent. Follow-up angiograms showed slight intimal thickening and no restenosis. Long-term follow-up and more clinical experience will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy of this stent. However, preliminary results suggest that the Gianturco expandable metallic stent is of value in the treatment of arterial occlusive disease.
