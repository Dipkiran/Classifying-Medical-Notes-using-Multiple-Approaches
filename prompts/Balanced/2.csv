You are a health professional, and you are classifying medical notes in one of the five categories: digestive system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, nervous system diseases, and general pathological conditions. 

Give downloadable output in CSV format, where the first column would be the note that I give as an input, and the second column will be one of the five categories associated with notes. Please do not write any explanations. 

Classify the following notes:
1.Disseminated Pneumocystis carinii infection with hepatic involvement in a patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Extrapulmonary infection with Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii) in AIDS patients is uncommon, and is often described only at postmortem examination. Although most antemortem cases involve spread to the bone marrow or spleen, P. carinii involvement of other organs has only recently been described. Despite the frequency of liver enzyme abnormalities in AIDS patients with a history of P. carinii pneumonia, P. carinii has been observed only rarely in the liver. We present a well-documented case of P. carinii involving the liver in an AIDS patient with P. carinii pneumonia and progressive liver enzyme abnormalities. We suggest that P. carinii infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of AIDS-related liver disease. 
2.Brief intensive chemotherapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a phase II study of the weekly CODE regimen. Fifty-three patients, 17 with stage IIIB and 36 with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer, were given CODE (cisplatin, vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide) plus antibiotic prophylaxis and an antiemetic regimen in an intensive chemotherapy program emphasizing weekly treatment and a planned brief duration (9-12 weeks); for 45 of these patients, the CODE program also included antifungal prophylaxis and supportive corticosteroids. Of the total study population, 33 patients (62%) responded to treatment, including five (9%) with complete response. The median survival for the entire group was 42 weeks (55 weeks for those with stage IIIB and 39 weeks for those with stage IV). More than 40% were alive at 1 year. Comparison of granulocyte counts of patients receiving prednisone with those of the subgroup to whom no corticosteroids were given showed less granulocytopenia for those receiving prednisone. Use of prednisone thus allowed improved delivery of myelosuppressive drugs. CODE was halted in nine patients because of disease progression. Although more constitutional side effects are associated with weekly chemotherapy than with standard chemotherapy, only 12 of the remaining 44 patients (27%) failed to receive at least 9 weeks of treatment. Serious toxicity was uncommon: There were no treatment-related deaths and only three episodes of neutropenia with fever. CODE is a novel treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer that this pilot study provided entirely in an outpatient setting over a 9-12 week period with an acceptable incidence of toxicity and a promising level of efficacy. Additional testing and comparison with other regimens or supportive care alone are warranted. 
3.Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients. The development of language skills in the isolated right hemisphere was investigated by comparing the performance of 3 left hemispherectomized with that of the 3 right hemispherectomized patients and three groups of control subjects on baseline clinical measures of language and on production and judgement of morphological markers. The initial brain insult in the hemispherectomy patients of each group had occurred either during early, middle or late childhood. The left hemispherectomy patients were severely impaired in language processing across all three stages of language development. The consequences of a right hemisphere insult on language development were more restricted, with deleterious effects being apparent only in the case in which the lesion was acquired during early childhood. 
4.Use of cytoplasmic 5'nucleotidase for differentiating malignant from benign monoclonal gammopathies. Bone marrow smears from 15 patients with multiple myeloma, 15 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and 15 control subjects were examined for the presence of cytoplasmic 5'nucleotidase (c5NT) in plasma cells. Plasma cell positivity for c5NT (mean and 95% confidence interval) in patients with multiple myeloma numbered 46.4% (38.0-54.8%), in those with MGUS it was 15.3% (11.1-19.6%), and in control subjects it was 1.2% (0.3-2.1%). These findings indicate that c5NT can be used to differentiate benign from malignant monoclonal gammopathies. 
5.Noncoordinate regulation of alpha-1 adrenoreceptor coupling and reexpression of alpha skeletal actin in myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure in rats. To determine the effects of myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure on the regulation of surface alpha-1 adrenoreceptors and signal transduction, large infarcts were produced in rats and the animals killed seven days later. After the documentation of impaired left ventricular pump performance, radioligand binding studies of the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor, norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositol turnover, and ADP ribosylation of 41 kD substrate by pertussis toxin were examined in the hypertrophying unaffected myocardium. Moreover, the expression of sarcomeric actin isoforms was analyzed by Northern blots and hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes. Alpha-1 adrenoreceptor density was found not to be altered in membranes obtained from the spared left ventricular tissue, whereas phosphoinositol turnover was increased 3.1-fold in the viable myocytes of infarcted hearts. Furthermore, pertussis toxin substrate was augmented 2.5-fold in membranes prepared from the surviving left ventricular myocardium. Finally, an upregulation of the skeletal actin isoform was detected in the tissue of the failing left ventricle. In conclusion, the possibility is raised that in the presence of severe myocardial dysfunction and ongoing reactive hypertrophy, effector pathways linked to the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor may stimulate the myocyte hypertrophic response which would tend to normalize cardiac hemodynamics. The reexpression of alpha skeletal actin may be a molecular indicator of the persistance of an overload on the myocardium. 
6.Ptychotropism as a cutaneous feature of the CHILD syndrome. The hallmark of the CHILD syndrome is a unilateral ichthyosiform nevus that displays a pronounced affinity for the body folds. For this phenomenon the term ptychotropism is proposed. The expression is composed from the Greek words ptyche (fold) and trope (a turning). It is concluded that the cutaneous lesions of the CHILD nevus are determined by two factors, lyonization and ptychotropism. The phenomenon of ptychotropism constitutes an additional argument to distinguish the CHILD nevus from the inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus because the latter is not ptychotropic. 
7.Results of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists in perinatal cerebral asphyxia therapy. Perinatal cerebral asphyxia, which results in significant neurologic and cognitive disabilities in infants and children, remains a major health problem. Potential neurologic sequelae include cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Over the next few years, neuroprotective agents that prevent asphyxial neuronal injury and death are likely to be developed. These agents may also be effective in prophylaxis and treatment of chronic neurologic disorders, including epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington disease. 
8.Naloxone and spinal fluid drainage as adjuncts in the surgical treatment of thoracoabdominal and thoracic aneurysms. Forty-seven patients who were treated for thoracoabdominal or thoracic aneurysms over a 5 1/2-year period were analyzed for neurologic deficit risk. Patients were divided into two groups for analysis. Twenty-four patients, who were treated from January 1984 to December 1986, did not undergo spinal fluid drainage or naloxone administration (group A). Twenty-three patients, who were treated from January 1987 to August 1989, had spinal fluid drainage (group B); 12 patients in this group also received naloxone as an intravenous drip at 1 microgram/kg/hr for 48 hours after surgery. Permanent neurologic deficits occurred in seven (29%) group A patients but in only one (4%) group B patient, who did not receive naloxone (p less than 0.03). The first two group B patients to receive naloxone showed complete reversal of neurologic deficits on waking from anesthesia. This significant reduction in neurologic deficit was associated with an increased 1-year survival rate (72% in group A, 91% in group B). We conclude that the use of naloxone and spinal fluid drainage reduces the incidence of neurologic deficit that is associated with repair of thoracoabdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms. This reduction in neurologic deficit is associated with improved survival in the long term. The observed reversal of postoperative neurologic deficits with naloxone implicates opiates as a major factor in the pathophysiology of spinal cord ischemia. 
9.Mycobacterium chelonei keratopathy with visual rehabilitation by a triple procedure. We report a chronic keratouveitis following an eye injury, the etiology of which remained obscure despite repeated corneal scrapings and cultures. Eventually, the diagnosis was established by culturing Mycobacterium chelonei from a corneal biopsy specimen. Topical amikacin resolved active inflammation, but dense corneal scarring and a cataract remained. Visual rehabilitation was achieved through a combined penetrating keratoplasty, extracapsular cataract extraction, and intraocular lens implantation. This case illustrates that there should be a high index of suspicion of atypical mycobacteria when faced with any unusual keratitis, particularly following penetrating injuries and corneal grafts. 
10.Flow cytometric DNA analysis of parathyroid tumors. Implication of aneuploidy for pathologic and biologic classification. The previous cytometric studies on parathyroid tumors have provided conflicting data regarding the relationship between DNA content and histopathology, resulting from differences in technical methods and data analysis. This study measured nuclear DNA of parathyroid tumors by flow cytometry in fresh material and determined whether DNA aneuploidy really assists in making a pathologic diagnosis of carcinoma or not. From May 1987 through April 1989, 65 consecutive patients operated on for primary hyperparathyroidism had DNA analysis of the freshly excised parathyroid tumors. Three of the patients had metastatic lesions of parathyroid carcinoma in the lung, cervical lymph nodes, and lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively. Pathologic classifications of the lesions from the other 62 patients were 54 adenomas, four carcinomas, and four hyperplasias. In all the latter patients, hyperplasia was associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Unequivocal evidence of aneuploidy was found in all of the metastatic lesions and 60% of the primary lesions of the carcinomas, in 9% of the adenomas and in 50% of the hyperplasias. Therefore, parathyroid carcinomas were more apt to be aneuploid than were adenomas (P = 0.0015, both-sided testing). In each of the cases of aneuploid hyperplasia, a small aneuploid peak was found. The high incidence of aneuploidy in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 may indicate the presence of clonal heterogeneity of hyperplastic glands and the presence of an abnormal subset of cells that have malignant potential. Cell distribution analysis did not provide any significant information beyond ploidy level. In conclusion, DNA flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy patterns is a valuable adjunct to the histopathologic diagnosis of parathyroid neoplasms.
